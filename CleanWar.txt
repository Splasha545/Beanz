general frowned
though there definite news austrian defeat there many circumstances confirming unfavorable rumors afloat kut zov suggestion austrian victory sounded much like irony

all officers men den sov squadron though tried talk other things look other directions thought only there hilltop kept constantly looking patches appearing skyline knew enemy troops
weather cleared again since noon sun descending brightly upon danube dark hills around 
calm intervals bugle calls shouts enemy could heard from hill
there one now between squadron enemy except few scattered skirmishers
empty space seven hundred yards all separated 
enemy ceased firing stern threatening inaccessible intangible line separates two hostile armies all more clearly felt
one step beyond boundary line resembles line dividing living from dead lies uncertainty suffering death
there there there beyond field tree roof lit sun one knows one wants know
fear yet long cross line know sooner later must crossed will find out there just will inevitably learn lies other side death
are strong healthy cheerful excited are surrounded other such excitedly animated healthy men
thinks rate feels anyone comes sight enemy feeling gives particular glamour glad keenness impression everything takes place such moments
high ground where enemy smoke cannon rose ball flew whistling over heads hussar squadron
officers been standing together rode off their places
hussars began carefully aligning their horses
all looking enemy front squadron commander awaiting word command
evidently firing hussars balls rapid rhythmic whistle flew over heads horsemen fell somewhere beyond 
hussars did look round sound each shot word command whole squadron rows faces alike yet different holding breath ball flew past rose stirrups sank back again

two vlograd squadrons having crossed bridge retired hill one after other
their colonel karl bogd nich schubert came den sov squadron rode footpace far from rost without taking notice although now meeting first time since their encounter concerning tely nin
rost feeling front power man toward whom now admitted been blame did lift eyes from colonel athletic back nape covered light hair red neck

next thought enemy would send squadron desperate attack just punish rost 
imagined after attack bogd nich would come lay wounded would magnanimously extend hand reconciliation
high shouldered figure zherk familiar vlograds recently left their regiment rode colonel
after dismissal from headquarters zherk remained regiment saying such fool slave front when could get more rewards doing nothing staff succeeded attaching himself orderly officer prince bagrati

their sabers catching bridles their spurs jingling hussars hastily dismounted knowing 
men crossing themselves
rost longer looked colonel time
afraid falling behind hussars much afraid heart stood still

den sov rode past leaning back shouting something

stretchers shouted someone behind 
rost did think call stretchers meant ran trying only ahead others just bridge looking ground came sticky trodden mud stumbled fell hands
boss zides captain heard voice colonel having ridden ahead pulled horse near bridge triumphant cheerful face
rost wiping muddy hands breeches looked enemy about run thinking farther went front better
bogd nich without looking recognizing rost shouted running middle bridge right come back cadet cried angrily turning den sov showing off courage ridden planks bridge why run risks captain should dismount said
every bullet billet answered ska den sov turning saddle
meanwhile nesv tski zherk officer suite standing together out range shots watching now small group men yellow shakos dark green jackets braided cord blue riding breeches swarming near bridge approaching distance from opposite side blue uniforms groups horses easily recognizable artillery
will burn bridge get there first will get there fire bridge will french get within grapeshot range wipe out questions each man troops high ground above bridge involuntarily asked himself sinking heart watching bridge hussars bright evening light blue tunics advancing from other side their bayonets guns

from all sides behind before far ear could reach there rattle wheels creaking carts gun carriages tramp horses crack whips shouts urging horses swearing soldiers orderlies officers
all along sides road fallen horses seen flayed broken down carts beside solitary soldiers sat waiting something again soldiers straggling from their companies crowds whom set off neighboring villages returned from dragging sheep fowls hay bulging sacks
each ascent descent road crowds yet denser din shouting more incessant
soldiers floundering knee deep mud pushed guns wagons themselves
whips cracked hoofs slipped traces broke lungs strained shouting
officers directing march rode backward forward between carts
their voices feebly heard amid uproar one saw their faces despaired possibility checking disorder
our dear orthodox russian army thought bolk nski recalling bil bin words
wishing find out where commander chief rode convoy
directly opposite came strange one horse vehicle evidently rigged soldiers out available materials looking like something between cart cabriolet cal che

passing kut zov carriage exhausted saddle horses suite their cossacks talking loudly together prince andrew entered passage
kut zov himself told house prince bagrati weyrother
weyrother austrian general succeeded schmidt
passage little kozl vski squatting heels front clerk
clerk cuffs turned hastily writing tub turned bottom upwards
kozl vski face looked worn evidently slept all night

second line
written continued dictating clerk
kiev grenadiers podolian
one can write fast your honor said clerk glancing angrily disrespectfully kozl vski
through door came sounds kut zov voiceexcited dissatisfied interrupted another unfamiliar voice
from sound voices inattentive way kozl vski looked disrespectful manner exhausted clerk fact clerk kozl vski squatting floor tub near commander chief from noisy laughter cossacks holding horses near window prince andrew felt something important disastrous about happen
turned kozl vski urgent questions
immediately prince said kozl vski
about capitulation nothing sort
prince andrew moved toward door from whence voices heard
just going open sounds ceased door opened kut zov eagle nose puffy face appeared doorway
prince andrew stood right front kut zov expression commander chief one sound eye showed preoccupied thoughts anxieties oblivious presence
looked straight adjutant face without recognizing 
well finished said kozl vski
one moment your excellency
bagrati gaunt middle aged man medium height firm impassive face oriental type came out after commander chief
honor present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing kut zov envelope
from vienna very good
later later kut zov went out into porch bagrati 
well good prince said bagrati 
blessing may christ your great endeavor face suddenly softened tears came into eyes
left hand drew bagrati toward right wore ring made sign cross over gesture evidently habitual offering puffy cheek bagrati kissed neck instead
christ kut zov repeated went toward carriage
get said bolk nski
your excellency should like use 
allow remain prince bagrati detachment
get said kut zov noticing bolk nski still delayed added need good officers myself need myself got into carriage drove few minutes silence
there still much much before said old man penetration understood all passing bolk nski mind
tenth part detachment returns shall thank god added speaking himself
prince andrew glanced kut zov face only foot distant from involuntarily noticed carefully washed seams scar near temple where ismail bullet pierced skull empty eye socket
yes right speak calmly those men death thought bolk nski
why beg sent detachment said
kut zov did reply
seemed forgotten been saying sat plunged thought
five minutes later gently swaying soft springs carriage turned prince andrew
there trace agitation face
delicate irony questioned prince andrew about details interview emperor about remarks heard court concerning krems affair about ladies both knew
november kut zov received through spy news army commanded almost hopeless position
spy reported french after crossing bridge vienna advancing immense force upon kut zov line communication troops arriving from russia
kut zov decided remain krems napoleon army one hundred fifty thousand men would cut off completely surround exhausted army forty thousand would find himself position mack ulm
kut zov decided abandon road connecting troops arriving from russia would march road into unknown parts bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces enemy abandoning all hope junction buxh wden
kut zov decided retreat along road from krems olm unite troops arriving from russia risked being forestalled road french crossed vienna bridge encumbered baggage transport having accept battle march against enemy three times strong would hem from two sides
kut zov chose latter course
french spy reported having crossed vienna bridge advancing forced marches toward znaim lay sixty six miles off line kut zov retreat
reached znaim before french there would great hope saving army let french forestall znaim meant exposure whole army disgrace such ulm utter destruction
forestall french whole army impossible
road french from vienna znaimshorter better than road russians from krems znaim
night received news kut zov sent bagrati vanguard four thousand strong right across hills from krems znaim vienna znaim road
bagrati make march without resting halt facing vienna znaim rear succeeded forestalling french delay long possible
kut zov himself all transport took road znaim
marching thirty miles stormy night across roadless hills hungry ill shod soldiers losing third men stragglers way bagrati came out viennaznaim road hollabr few hours ahead french approaching hollabr from vienna
kut zov transport still march days before could reach znaim
hence bagrati four thousand hungry exhausted men would detain days whole enemy army came upon hollabr clearly impossible
freak fate made impossible possible
success trick placed vienna bridge hands french without fight led murat try deceive kut zov similar way
meeting bagrati weak detachment znaim road supposed kut zov whole army
able crush absolutely awaited arrival rest troops their way from vienna object offered three days truce condition both armies should remain position without moving
murat declared negotiations peace already proceeding therefore offered truce avoid unnecessary bloodshed
count nostitz austrian general occupying advanced posts believed murat emissary retired leaving bagrati division exposed
another emissary rode russian line announce peace negotiations offer russian army three days truce
bagrati replied authorized either accept refuse truce sent adjutant kut zov report offer received
truce kut zov sole chance gaining time giving bagrati exhausted troops rest letting transport heavy convoys whose movements concealed from french advance one stage nearer znaim
offer truce gave only quite unexpected chance saving army
receiving news immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode attendance enemy camp
wintzingerode merely agree truce also offer terms capitulation meanwhile kut zov sent adjutants back hasten utmost movements baggage trains entire army along krems znaim road
bagrati exhausted hungry detachment alone covered movement transport whole army remain stationary face enemy eight times strong itself
kut zov expectations proposals capitulation way binding might give time part transport pass also murat mistake would very soon discovered proved correct
soon bonaparte sch nbrunn sixteen miles from hollabr received murat dispatch proposal truce capitulation detected ruse wrote following letter murat sch nbrunn 25th brumaire 1805 eight clock morning prince murat cannot find words express displeasure
command only advance guard right arrange armistice without order
are causing lose fruits campaign
break armistice immediately march enemy
inform general signed capitulation rightone emperor russia right
however emperor russia ratifies convention will ratify only trick
are position seize baggage artillery
russian emperor aide camp impostor
officers are nothing when powers one none

prince andrew glanced again artillery officer small figure
there something peculiar about quite unsoldierly rather comic extremely attractive
staff officer prince andrew mounted their horses rode 
having ridden beyond village continually meeting overtaking soldiers officers various regiments saw their left entrenchments being thrown freshly dug clay showed red
several battalions soldiers their shirt sleeves despite cold wind swarmed earthworks like host white ants spadefuls red clay continually being thrown from behind bank unseen hands
prince andrew officer rode looked entrenchment went again
just behind came upon dozens soldiers continually replaced others ran from entrenchment
hold their noses put their horses trot escape from poisoned atmosphere latrines

thank very much will alone said prince andrew wishing rid himself staff officer company please don trouble yourself further
staff officer remained behind prince andrew rode alone
farther forward nearer enemy went more orderly cheerful troops
greatest disorder depression been baggage train passed morning znaim road seven miles away from french
grunth also apprehension alarm could felt nearer prince andrew came french lines more confident appearance our troops
soldiers their greatcoats ranged lines sergeants major company officers counting men poking last man each section ribs telling hold hand 
soldiers scattered over whole place dragging logs brushwood building shelters merry chatter laughter around fires sat others dressed undressed drying their shirts leg bands mending boots overcoats crowding round boilers porridge cookers
one company dinner ready soldiers gazing eagerly steaming boiler waiting till sample quartermaster sergeant carrying wooden bowl officer sat log before shelter been tasted
another company lucky one all companies vodka crowded round pockmarked broad shouldered sergeant major tilting keg filled one after another canteen lids held out 
soldiers lifted canteen lids their lips reverential faces emptied rolling vodka their mouths walked away from sergeant major brightened expressions licking their lips wiping sleeves their greatcoats
all their faces serene all happening home awaiting peaceful encampment within sight enemy before action least half would left field
after passing chasseur regiment lines kiev grenadiers fine fellows busy similar peaceful affairs near shelter regimental commander higher than different from others prince andrew came out front platoon grenadiers before whom lay naked man
two soldiers held two others flourishing their switches striking regularly bare back
stout major pacing down line regardless screams kept repeating shame soldier steal soldier must honest honorable brave robs fellows there honor scoundrel
swishing sound strokes desperate unnatural screams continued
said major
young officer bewildered pained expression face stepped away from man looked round inquiringly adjutant rode 
prince andrew having reached front line rode along 
our front line enemy far apart right left flanks center where men flag truce passed morning lines near together men could see one anotherfaces speak one another
besides soldiers formed picket line either side there many curious onlookers jesting laughing stared their strange foreign enemies
since early morning despite injunction approach picket line officers been unable keep sight seers away
soldiers forming picket line like showmen exhibiting curiosity longer looked french paid attention sight seers grew weary waiting relieved
prince andrew halted look french
look look there one soldier saying another pointing russian musketeer gone picket line officer rapidly excitedly talking french grenadier
hark jabbering fine isn all frenchy can keep 
there now dorov wait bit listen
fine answered dorov considered adept french
soldier whom laughers referred lokhov
prince andrew recognized stopped listen saying
lokhov come from left flank where their regiment stationed captain
now incited officer bending forward trying lose word speech incomprehensible 
more please more saying lokhov did answer captain been drawn into hot dispute french grenadier
frenchman confusing austrians russians trying prove russians surrendered fled all way from ulm lokhov maintained russians surrendered beaten french
orders drive off shall drive off said lokhov
only take care your cossacks are all captured said french grenadier
french onlookers listeners laughed
make dance did under suv rov
est chante asked frenchman
ancient history said another guessing referred former war
emperor will teach your suvara taught others
bonaparte
began lokhov frenchman interrupted 
bonaparte

lokhov swore coarse soldier russian shouldering musket walked away
let luk said captain
way talk french said picket soldiers
now dorov try dorov turning french winked began jabber meaningless sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kask said trying give expressive intonation voice
ouh ouh came peals such healthy good humored laughter from soldiers infected french involuntarily much only thing left seemed unload muskets explode ammunition all return home quickly possible
guns remained loaded loopholes blockhouses entrenchments looked out just menacingly unlimbered cannon confronted one another before
having ridden round whole line from right flank left prince andrew made way battery from staff officer told whole field could seen
dismounted stopped beside farthest four unlimbered cannon
before guns artillery sentry pacingdown stood attention when officer arrived sign resumed measured monotonous pacing
behind guns their limbers still farther back picket ropes artillerymen bonfires
left far from farthest cannon small newly constructed wattle shed from came sound officers voices eager conversation
true view over nearly whole russian position greater part enemy opened out from battery
just facing crest opposite hillvillage sch grabern could seen three places left right french troops amid smoke their campfires greater part whom evidently village itself behind hill
left from village amid smoke something resembling battery impossible see clearly naked eye
our right flank posted rather steep incline dominated french position
our infantry stationed there farthest point dragoons
center where shin battery stood from prince andrew surveying position easiest most direct descent ascent brook separating from sch grabern
left our troops close copse smoked bonfires our infantry felling wood
french line wider than ours plain could easily outflank both sides
behind our position steep deep dip making difficult artillery cavalry retire
prince andrew took out notebook leaning cannon sketched plan position
made notes two points intending mention bagrati 
idea first concentrate all artillery center secondly withdraw cavalry other side dip
prince andrew being always near commander chief closely following mass movements general orders constantly studying historical accounts battles involuntarily pictured himself course events forthcoming action broad outline
imagined only important possibilities enemy attacks right flank said himself kiev grenadiers pod lsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from center come 
case dragoons could successfully make flank counterattack
attack our center having center battery high ground shall withdraw left flank under cover retreat dip echelons
all time been beside gun heard voices officers distinctly often happens understood word saying
suddenly however struck voice coming from shed tone sincere could listen
friend said pleasant seemed prince andrew familiar voice say possible know beyond death none would afraid 
another younger voice interrupted afraid can escape anyhow
all same one afraid clever people said third manly voice interrupting both
course artillery men are very wise can take everything along vodka snacks
owner manly voice evidently infantry officer laughed
yes one afraid continued first speaker familiar voice
one afraid unknown 
whatever may say about soul going sky
know there sky only atmosphere
manly voice again interrupted artillery officer
well stand your herb vodka shin said
why thought prince andrew captain stood sutler hut without boots
recognized agreeable philosophizing voice pleasure
herb vodka certainly said shin
still conceive future life
did finish
just there whistle air nearer nearer faster louder louder faster cannon ball finished saying necessary thudded into ground near shed super human force throwing mass earth
ground seemed groan terrible impact
immediately shin short pipe corner mouth kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out shed followed owner manly voice dashing infantry officer hurried off company buttoning coat ran
mounting horse again prince andrew lingered battery looking puff from gun sent ball
eyes ran rapidly over wide space only saw hitherto motionless masses french now swayed there really battery their left
smoke above yet dispersed
two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants galloping hill
small distinctly visible enemy column moving down hill probably strengthen front line
smoke first shot yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed report
battle begun prince andrew turned horse galloped back grunth find prince bagrati 
heard cannonade behind growing louder more frequent
evidently our guns begun reply
from bottom slope where parleys taken place came report musketry
lemarrois just arrived gallop bonaparte stern letter murat humiliated anxious expiate fault once moved forces attack center outflank both russian wings hoping before evening before arrival emperor crush contemptible detachment stood before 
begun
thought prince andrew feeling blood rush heart
where will toulon present itself passing between companies been eating porridge drinking vodka quarter hour before saw everywhere same rapid movement soldiers forming ranks getting their muskets ready all their faces recognized same eagerness filled heart
begun dreadful enjoyable face each soldier each officer seemed say
before reached embankments being thrown saw light dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward 
foremost wearing cossack cloak lambskin cap riding white horse prince bagrati 
prince andrew stopped waiting come prince bagrati reined horse recognizing prince andrew nodded 
still looked ahead prince andrew told seen
feeling begun seen even prince bagrati hard brown face half closed dull sleepy eyes
prince andrew gazed anxious curiosity impassive face wished could tell anything man thinking feeling moment
there anything all behind impassive face prince andrew asked himself looked
prince bagrati bent head sign agreement prince andrew told said very good tone seemed imply everything took place reported exactly foreseen
prince andrew out breath rapid ride spoke quickly
prince bagrati uttering words oriental accent spoke particularly slowly impress fact there need hurry
however put horse trot direction shin battery
prince andrew followed suite
behind prince bagrati rode officer suite prince personal adjutant zherk orderly officer staff officer duty riding fine bobtailed horse civilian accountant asked permission present battle out curiosity
accountant stout full faced man looked around smile satisfaction presented strange appearance among hussars cossacks adjutants camlet coat jolted horse convoy officer saddle
wants see battle said zherk bolk nski pointing accountant feels pain pit stomach already
leave off said accountant beaming rather cunning smile flattered being made subject zherk joke purposely trying appear stupider than really 
very strange mon monsieur prince said staff officer
remembered french there peculiar way addressing prince could get quite right
time all approaching shin battery ball struck ground front 
fallen asked accountant smile
french pancake answered zherk 
hit asked accountant
awful seemed swell satisfaction
hardly finished speaking when again heard unexpectedly violent whistling suddenly ended thud into something soft
flop cossack riding little their right behind accountant crashed earth horse
zherk staff officer bent over their saddles turned their horses away
accountant stopped facing cossack examined attentive curiosity
cossack dead horse still struggled
prince bagrati screwed eyes looked round seeing cause confusion turned away indifference say worth noticing trifles reined horse care skillful rider slightly bending over disengaged saber caught cloak
old fashioned saber kind longer general use
prince andrew remembered story suv rov giving saber bagrati italy recollection particularly pleasant moment
reached battery prince andrew been when examined battlefield
whose company asked prince bagrati artilleryman standing ammunition wagon
asked whose company really meant are frightened artilleryman understood 
captain shin your excellency shouted red haired freckled gunner merry voice standing attention
yes yes muttered bagrati considering something rode past limbers farthest cannon
approached ringing shot issued from deafening suite smoke suddenly surrounded gun could see gunners seized straining roll quickly back former position
huge broad shouldered gunner number one holding mop legs far apart sprang wheel number two trembling hand placed charge cannon mouth
short round shouldered captain shin stumbling over tail gun carriage moved forward noticing general looked out shading eyes small hand
lift two lines more will just right cried feeble voice tried impart dashing note ill suited weak figure
fire medv dev bagrati called shin raising three fingers cap bashful awkward gesture all like military salute like priest benediction approached general
though shin guns been intended cannonade valley firing incendiary balls village sch grabern visible just opposite front large masses french advancing
one given shin orders where fire after consulting sergeant major zakharch nko whom great respect decided would good thing set fire village
very good said bagrati reply officer report began deliberately examine whole battlefield extended before 
french advanced nearest our right
below height kiev regiment stationed hollow where rivulet flowed soul stirring rolling crackling musketry heard much farther right beyond dragoons officer suite pointed out bagrati french column outflanking 
left horizon bounded adjacent wood
prince bagrati ordered two battalions from center sent reinforce right flank
officer suite ventured remark prince battalions went away guns would remain without support
prince bagrati turned officer dull eyes looked silence
seemed prince andrew officer remark just really answer could made 
moment adjutant galloped message from commander regiment hollow news immense masses french coming down upon regiment disorder retreating upon kiev grenadiers
prince bagrati bowed head sign assent approval
rode off walk right sent adjutant dragoons orders attack french
adjutant returned half hour later news commander dragoons already retreated beyond dip ground heavy fire been opened losing men uselessly hastened throw sharpshooters into wood
very good said bagrati 
leaving battery firing heard left also far left flank time there himself prince bagrati sent zherk tell general command one paraded regiment before kut zov braunau must retreat quickly possible behind hollow rear right flank would probably able withstand enemy attack very long
about shin battalion been support battery all forgotten
prince andrew listened attentively bagrati colloquies commanding officers orders gave surprise found orders really given prince bagrati tried make appear everything done necessity accident will subordinate commanders done direct command least accord intentions
prince andrew noticed however though happened due chance independent commander will owing tact bagrati showed presence very valuable
officers approached disturbed countenances became calm soldiers officers greeted gaily grew more cheerful presence evidently anxious display their courage before 
prince bagrati having reached highest point our right flank began riding downhill where roll musketry heard where account smoke nothing could seen
nearer got hollow less could see more felt nearness actual battlefield
one bleeding head cap being dragged along two soldiers supported under arms
there gurgle throat spitting blood
bullet evidently hit throat mouth
another walking sturdily himself without musket groaning aloud swinging arm just been hurt blood from streaming over greatcoat from bottle
moment been wounded face showed fear rather than suffering
crossing road descended steep incline saw several men lying ground also met crowd soldiers whom unwounded
soldiers ascending hill breathing heavily despite general presence talking loudly gesticulating
front rows gray cloaks already visible through smoke officer catching sight bagrati rushed shouting after crowd retreating soldiers ordering back
bagrati rode ranks along shots crackled now now there drowning sound voices shouts command
excited faces soldiers blackened 
using their ramrods others putting powder touchpans taking charges from their pouches others firing though firing could seen smoke there wind carry away
pleasant humming whistling bullets often heard
thought prince andrew approaching crowd soldiers
can attack are moving can square are drawn 
commander regiment thin feeble looking old man pleasant smile eyelids drooping more than half over old eyes giving mild expression rode bagrati welcomed host welcomes honored guest
reported regiment been attacked french cavalry though attack been repulsed lost more than half men
said attack been repulsed employing military term describe occurred regiment reality did himself know happened during half hour troops entrusted could say certainty whether attack been repulsed regiment been broken 
all knew commencement action balls shells began flying all over regiment hitting men afterwards someone shouted cavalry our men begun firing
still firing cavalry disappeared french infantry come into hollow firing our men
prince bagrati bowed head sign exactly desired expected
turning adjutant ordered bring down two battalions sixth chasseurs whom just passed
prince andrew struck changed expression prince bagrati face moment
expressed concentrated happy resolution see face man hot day takes final run before plunging into water
dull sleepy expression longer there nor affectation profound thought
round steady hawk eyes looked before eagerly rather disdainfully resting anything although movements still slow measured
commander regiment turned prince bagrati entreating back dangerous remain where 
please your excellency god sake kept saying glancing support officer suite turned away from 
there see drew attention bullets whistling singing hissing continually around 
spoke tone entreaty reproach carpenter uses gentleman picked are used sir will blister your hands
spoke those bullets could kill half closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness words
staff officer joined colonel appeals bagrati did reply only gave order cease firing form give room two approaching battalions
speaking curtain smoke concealed hollow driven rising wind began move from right left drawn invisible hand hill opposite french moving about opened out before 
all eyes fastened involuntarily french column advancing against winding down over uneven ground
one could already see soldiers shaggy caps distinguish officers from men see standard flapping against staff
march splendidly remarked someone bagrati suite
head column already descended into hollow
clash would take place side 
remains our regiment been action rapidly formed moved right from behind dispersing laggards came two battalions sixth chasseurs fine order
before reached bagrati weighty tread mass men marching step could heard
their left flank nearest bagrati marched company commander fine round faced man stupid happy expression same man rushed out wattle shed
moment clearly thinking nothing dashing fellow would appear passed commander
self satisfaction man parade stepped lightly muscular legs sailing along stretching himself full height without smallest effort ease contrasting heavy tread soldiers keeping step 
carried close leg narrow unsheathed sword small curved like real weapon looked now superior officers now back men without losing step whole powerful body turning flexibly
all powers soul concentrated passing commander best possible manner feeling doing well happy
seemed repeat himself each alternate step time stern varied faces wall soldiers burdened knapsacks muskets marched step each one hundreds soldiers seemed repeating himself each alternate step left
fat major skirted bush puffing falling out step soldier fallen behind face showing alarm defection ran trot panting catch company
cannon ball cleaving air flew over heads bagrati suite fell into column measure left
left close came company commander voice jaunty tones
soldiers passed semicircle round something where ball fallen old trooper flank noncommissioned officer stopped beside dead men ran catch line falling into step hop looked back angrily through ominous silence regular tramp feet beating ground unison one seemed hear left
well done lads said prince bagrati 
glad our best your len lency came confused shout from ranks
morose soldier marching left turned eyes bagrati shouted expression seemed say know ourselves another without looking round though fearing relax shouted mouth wide open passed 
order given halt down knapsacks
bagrati rode round ranks marched past dismounted
gave reins cossack took off handed over felt coat stretched legs set cap straight
head french column officers leading appeared from below hill
forward god said bagrati resolute sonorous voice turning moment front line slightly swinging arms went forward uneasily over rough field awkward gait cavalryman
prince andrew felt invisible power leading forward experienced great happiness
french already near
prince andrew walking beside bagrati could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets even their faces
distinctly saw old french officer gaitered legs turned out toes climbed hill difficulty
prince bagrati gave further orders silently continued walk front ranks
suddenly one shot after another rang out from french smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks musket shots sounded
several our men fell among round faced officer marched gaily complacently
moment first report heard bagrati looked round shouted hurrah hurrah rang long drawn shout from our ranks passing bagrati racing one another rushed irregular joyous eager crowd down hill their disordered foe
attack sixth chasseurs secured retreat our right flank
center shin forgotten battery managed set fire sch grabern village delayed french advance
french putting out fire wind spreading thus gave time retreat
retirement center other side dip ground rear hurried noisy different companies did get mixed
our left consisted pod lsk infantry vlograd hussars simultaneously attacked outflanked superior french forces under lannes thrown into confusion
bagrati sent zherk general commanding left flank orders retreat immediately
zherk removing hand from cap turned horse about galloped off
sooner left bagrati than courage failed 
seized panic could where dangerous
having reached left flank instead going front where firing began look general staff where could possibly did deliver order
command left flank belonged seniority commander regiment kut zov reviewed braunau lokhov serving private
command extreme left flank been assigned commander vlograd regiment rost serving misunderstanding arose
two commanders much exasperated one anotherlong after action begun right flank french already advancing engaged discussion sole object offending one another
regiments both cavalry infantry means ready impending action
from privates general expecting battle engaged peaceful occupations cavalry feeding horses infantry collecting wood
higher iss dan rank said german colonel hussarsflushing addressing adjutant ridden let vill cannot sacrifice hussars
bugler sount retreat haste becoming imperative
cannon musketry mingling together thundered right center capotes lannes sharpshooters already seen crossing milldam forming within twice range musket shot
general command infantry went toward horse jerky steps having mounted drew himself very straight tall rode vlograd commander
commanders met polite bows secret malevolence their hearts
once again colonel said general can leave half men wood
beg beg repeated occupy position prepare attack
peg yourself mix vot your business suddenly replied irate colonel
cavalry colonel russian general are aware fact

vill goot come front see dat zis position iss goot don vish destroy men your pleasure forget yourself colonel
considering own pleasure won allow said taking colonel outburst challenge courage general expanded chest rode frowning beside front line their differences would settled there amongst bullets
reached front several bullets sped over halted silence
there nothing fresh seen from line from where been before been evident impossible cavalry act among bushes broken ground well french outflanking our left
general colonel looked sternly significantly one another like two fighting cocks preparing battle each vainly trying detect signs cowardice other
both passed examination successfully
there nothing said neither wished give occasion alleged been first leave range fire would remained there long time testing each other courage been just heard rattle musketry muffled shout almost behind wood
french attacked men collecting wood copse
longer possible hussars retreat infantry
cut off from line retreat left french
however inconvenient position now necessary attack order cut way through themselves
squadron rost serving scarcely time mount before halted facing enemy
again enns bridge there nothing between squadron enemy again terrible dividing line uncertainty fear resembling line separating living from dead lay between 
allconscious unseen line question whether would cross would cross agitated all
colonel rode front angrily gave reply questions put officers like man desperately insisting having own way gave order
one said anything definite rumor attack spread through squadron
command form rang out sabers whizzed drawn from their scabbards
still one moved
troops left flank infantry hussars alike felt commander did himself know irresolution communicated itself men
only would quick thought rost feeling last time come experience joy attack often heard from fellow hussars
ward god lads rang out den sov voice
twot ward horses croups began sway front line
rook pulled reins started own accord
before right rost saw front lines hussars still farther ahead dark line could see distinctly took enemy
faster came word command rost felt rook flanks drooping broke into gallop
rost anticipated horse movements became more more elated
noticed solitary tree ahead 
tree been middle line seemed terrible now crossed line only there nothing terrible everything becoming more more happy animated
will slash thought rost gripping hilt saber
hur came roar voices
let anyone come way now thought rost driving spurs into rook letting full gallop outstripped others
ahead enemy already visible
suddenly something like birch broom seemed sweep over squadron
rost raised saber ready strike instant trooper nik tenko galloping ahead shot away from rost felt dream continued carried forward unnatural speed yet stayed same spot
from behind bondarch hussar knew jolted against looked angrily 
moving fallen killed rost asked answered same instant
instead moving horses hussars backs saw nothing before motionless earth stubble around 
there warm blood under arm
wounded horse killed
rook tried rise forelegs fell back pinning rider leg
blood flowing from head struggled could rise
rost also tried rise fell back sabretache having become entangled saddle
where our men where french did know
there one near
having disentangled leg rose
where side now line sharply divided two armies asked himself could answer
can something bad happened wondered got moment felt something superfluous hanging benumbed left arm
examined hand carefully vainly trying find blood 
are people coming thought joyfully seeing men running toward 
will help front came man wearing strange shako blue cloak swarthy sunburned hooked nose
came two more many more running behind
one said something strange russian
among hindmost men wearing similar shakos russian hussar
being held arms horse being led behind 
must one ours prisoner
can will take are men thought rost scarcely believing eyes
can french looked approaching frenchmen though moment before been galloping get hack pieces their proximity now seemed awful could believe eyes
are why are running can coming why kill whom everyone fond remembered mother love family friends enemy intention kill seemed impossible
perhaps may more than ten seconds stood moving from spot realizing situation
foremost frenchman one hooked nose already close expression face could seen
excited alien face man bayonet hanging down holding breath running lightly frightened rost 
seized pistol instead firing flung frenchman ran all might toward bushes
did now run feeling doubt conflict trodden enns bridge feeling hare fleeing from hounds
one single sentiment fear young happy life possessed whole being
rapidly leaping furrows fled across field impetuosity used show catchplay now turning good natured pale young face look back
shudder terror went through better look thought having reached bushes glanced round once more
french fallen behind just looked round first man changed run walk turning shouted something loudly comrade farther back
there mistake thought 
same time left arm felt heavy seventy pound weight tied 
could run more
rost closed eyes stooped down
mustered last remaining strength took hold left hand right reached bushes
behind russian sharpshooters
infantry regiments been caught unawares outskirts wood ran out different companies getting mixed retreated disorderly crowd
one soldier fear uttered senseless cry cut off terrible battle word infected whole crowd feeling panic
surrounded cut off lost shouted fugitives
moment heard firing cry from behind general realized something dreadful happened regiment thought exemplary officer many years service never been blame might held responsible headquarters negligence inefficiency staggered forgetting recalcitrant cavalry colonel own dignity general above all quite forgetting danger all regard self preservation clutched crupper saddle spurring horse galloped regiment under hail bullets fell around fortunately missed 
one desire know happening cost correct remedy mistake made one exemplary officer twenty two years service never been censured should held blame
having galloped safely through french reached field behind copse across our men regardless orders running descending valley
moment moral hesitation decides fate battles arrived
would disorderly crowd soldiers attend voice their commander would disregarding continue their flight despite desperate shouts used seem terrible soldiers despite furious purple countenance distorted out all likeness former self flourishing saber soldiers all continued run talking firing into air disobeying orders
moral hesitation decided fate battles evidently culminating panic
general fit coughing result shouting powder smoke stopped despair
moment french attacking suddenly without apparent reason ran back disappeared from outskirts russian sharpshooters showed themselves copse
tim khin company alone maintained order wood having lain ambush ditch now attacked french unexpectedly
tim khin armed only sword rushed enemy such desperate cry such mad drunken determination taken surprise french thrown down their muskets run
lokhov running beside tim khin killed frenchman close quarters first seize surrendering french officer collar
our fugitives returned battalions formed french nearly cut our left flank half moment repulsed
our reserve units able join fight end
regimental commander major ekon mov stopped beside bridge letting retreating companies pass when soldier came took hold commander stirrup almost leaning against 
man wearing bluish coat broadcloth knapsack cap head bandaged over shoulder french munition pouch slung
officer sword hand
soldier pale blue eyes looked impudently into commander face lips smiling
though commander occupied giving instructions major ekon mov could help taking notice soldier
your excellency are two trophies said lokhov pointing french sword pouch
stopped company
lokhov breathed heavily from weariness spoke abrupt sentences
beg will remember your excellency all right all right replied commander turned major ekon mov
lokhov did away untied handkerchief around head pulled off showed blood congealed hair
bayonet wound
remember your excellency shin battery been forgotten only very end action did prince bagrati still hearing cannonade center send orderly staff officer later prince andrew also order battery retire quickly possible
when supports attached shin battery been moved away middle action someone order battery continued firing only captured french enemy could surmise anyone could effrontery continue firing from four quite undefended guns
contrary energetic action battery led french suppose center main russian forces concentrated
twice attempted attack point each occasion been driven back grapeshot from four isolated guns hillock
soon after prince bagrati left shin succeeded setting fire sch grabern
look scurrying burning just see smoke fine grand look smoke smoke exclaimed artillerymen brightening 
all guns without waiting orders being fired direction conflagration
urging each other soldiers cried each shot fine good look 
grand fire fanned breeze rapidly spreading
french columns advanced beyond village went back though revenge failure enemy placed ten guns right village began firing shin battery
their childlike glee aroused fire their luck successfully cannonading french our artillerymen only noticed battery when two balls four more fell among our guns one knocking over two horses another tearing off munition wagon driver leg
their spirits once roused however diminished only changed character
horses replaced others from reserve gun carriage wounded carried away four guns turned against ten gun battery
shin companion officer been killed beginning engagement within hour seventeen forty men guns crews been disabled artillerymen still merry lively ever
twice noticed french appearing below fired grapeshot 
little shin moving feebly awkwardly kept telling orderly refill pipe one scattering sparks from ran forward shading eyes small hand look french
smack lads kept saying seizing guns wheels working screws himself
amid smoke deafened incessant reports always made jump shin taking pipe from mouth ran from gun gun now aiming now counting charges now giving orders about replacing dead wounded horses harnessing fresh ones shouting feeble voice high pitched irresolute
face grew more more animated
only when man killed wounded did frown turn away from sight shouting angrily men always case hesitated about lifting injured dead
soldiers most part handsome fellows always case artillery company head shoulders taller twice broad their officer all looked their commander like children embarrassing situation expression face invariably reflected theirs
owing terrible uproar necessity concentration activity shin did experience slightest unpleasant sense fear thought might killed badly wounded never occurred 
contrary became more more elated
seemed very long time ago almost day since first seen enemy fired first shot corner field stood well known familiar ground
though thought everything considered everything did everything best officers could position state akin feverish delirium drunkenness
from deafening sounds own guns around whistle thud enemy cannon balls from flushed perspiring faces crew bustling round guns from sight blood men horses from little puffs smoke enemy side always followed ball flying past striking earth man gun horse from sight all things fantastic world own taken possession brain moment afforded pleasure
enemy guns fancy guns pipes from occasional puffs blown invisible smoker
there
puffing again muttered shin himself small cloud rose from hill borne streak left wind
now look out ball
want your honor asked artilleryman standing close heard muttering
nothing
come along our matv vna said himself
matv vna name fancy gave farthest gun battery large old pattern
french swarming round their guns seemed like ants
world handsome drunkard number one second gun crew uncle shin looked more often than anyone else took delight every movement
sound musketry foot hill now diminishing now increasing seemed like someone breathing
listened intently ebb flow sounds
breathing again breathing muttered himself
imagined himself enormously tall powerful man throwing cannon balls french both hands
now matv vna dear old lady don let down saying moved from gun when strange unfamiliar voice called above head captain shin captain shin turned round dismay
staff officer turned out booth grunth
shouting gasping voice are mad twice been ordered retreat 
why are down thought shin looking alarm superior

muttered holding two fingers cap
staff officer did finish wanted say
cannon ball flying close caused duck bend over horse
paused just about say something more another ball stopped 
retire all retire shouted from distance
soldiers laughed
moment later adjutant arrived same order
prince andrew
first thing saw riding space where shin guns stationed unharnessed horse broken leg lay screaming piteously beside harnessed horses
blood gushing from leg from spring
among limbers lay several dead men
one ball after another passed over approached felt nervous shudder run down spine
mere thought being afraid roused again
cannot afraid thought dismounted slowly among guns
delivered order did leave battery
decided guns removed from their positions withdrawn presence
together shin stepping across bodies under terrible fire from french attended removal guns
staff officer minute ago skipped off said artilleryman prince andrew
like your honor prince andrew said nothing shin
both busy seem notice one another
when having limbered only two cannon remained uninjured out four began moving down hill one shattered gun one unicorn left behind prince andrew rode shin
well till meet again
said holding out hand shin
good dear fellow said shin
dear soul good dear fellow unknown reason tears suddenly filled eyes
wind fallen black clouds merging powder smoke hung low over field battle horizon
growing dark glow two conflagrations more conspicuous

formerly anna vlovna presence pierre always felt saying out place tactless unsuitable remarks seemed clever formed mind became foolish soon uttered contrary hippolyte stupidest remarks came out clever apt
even anna vlovna did say could see wished only refrained out regard modesty
beginning winter 1805 pierre received one anna vlovna usual pink notes invitation added will find beautiful whom always delightful see
when read sentence pierre felt first time link other people recognized grown between himself thought both alarmed obligation being imposed could fulfill pleased entertaining supposition
anna vlovna home like former one only novelty offered guests time mortemart diplomatist fresh from berlin very latest details emperor alexander visit potsdam two august friends pledged themselves indissoluble alliance uphold cause justice against enemy human race
anna vlovna received pierre shade melancholy evidently relating young man recent loss death count bez khov everyone constantly considered duty assure pierre greatly afflicted death father hardly known melancholy just like august melancholy showed mention most august majesty empress rya dorovna

half rose meaning round aunt handed snuffbox passing across back
stooped forward make room looked round smile
always evening parties wearing dress such fashionable cut very low front back
bust always seemed like marble pierre close shortsighted eyes could perceive living charm neck shoulders near lips need only bent head little touched 
conscious warmth body scent perfume creaking corset moved
did see marble beauty forming complete whole dress all charm body only covered garments
having once seen could help being aware just cannot renew illusion once seen through
never noticed before beautiful seemed say
noticed woman yes woman may belong anyone said glance
moment pierre felt only could must wife could otherwise
knew moment surely been standing altar 
when would did know did even know would good thing even felt knew why would bad thing knew would happen
pierre dropped eyes lifted again wished once more see distant beauty far removed from seen every day until could longer 
could more than man been looking tuft steppe grassthrough mist taking tree can again take tree after once recognized tuft grass
already power over between there longer barrier except barrier own will

paused women always expecting something after mentioned their age
marry will different thing continued uniting both one glance
pierre did look nor 
muttered something colored
when got home could sleep long time thinking happened
merely understood woman known child whom when beauty mentioned said absent mindedly yes good looking understood woman might belong 
stupid
myself said stupid thought
there something nasty something wrong feeling excites 
been told brother anatole love there quite scandal why sent away
hippolyte brother
reflected thinking reflection still incomplete caught himself smiling conscious another line thought sprung thinking worthlessness also dreaming would wife would love become quite different all thought heard might false
again saw daughter prince vas visualized whole body only veiled gray dress
why did thought never occur before again told himself impossible there would something unnatural seemed dishonorable marriage
recalled former words looks words looks those seen together
recalled anna vlovna words looks when spoke about house recalled thousands such hints from prince vas others seized terror lest already way bound himself something evidently wrong ought 
very time expressing conviction himself another part mind image rose all womanly beauty
november 1805 prince vas tour inspection four different provinces
arranged himself visit neglected estates same time pick son anatole where regiment stationed take visit prince nicholas bolk nski order arrange match daughter rich old man
before leaving home undertaking new affairs prince vas settle matters pierre true latterly spent whole days home prince vas house where staying been absurd excited foolish presence lover should yet proposed

might perhaps been able free himself prince vas rarely before given receptions now hardly let day without having evening party pierre present unless wished spoil general pleasure disappoint everyone expectation
prince vas rare moments when home would take pierre hand passing draw downwards absent mindedly hold out wrinkled clean shaven cheek pierre kiss would say till tomorrow dinner shall see staying your sake 
though prince vas when stayed said pierre sake hardly exchanged couple words pierre felt unable disappoint 
every day said himself one same thing time understood made mind really 
mistaken before mistaken now stupidexcellent girl sometimes said himself never makes mistake never says anything stupid
says little does say always clear simple stupid
never abashed abashed now cannot bad woman often begun make reflections think aloud company always answered either brief appropriate remark showing did interest silent look smile more palpably than anything else showed pierre superiority
right regarding all arguments nonsense comparison smile
always addressed radiantly confiding smile meant alone there something more significant than general smile usually brightened face
pierre knew everyone waiting say word cross certain line knew sooner later would stepacross incomprehensible terror seized thought dreadful step
thousand times during month half felt himself drawn nearer nearer dreadful abyss pierre said himself doing need resolution
can none wished take decision felt dismay matter lacked strength will known himself really possessed
pierre one those are only strong when feel themselves quite innocent since day when overpowered feeling desire stooping over snuffbox anna vlovna unacknowledged sense guilt desire paralyzed will

very very nice honest pleasant fellow answered bor

rost truthful young man would account told deliberate lie
began story meaning tell everything just happened imperceptibly involuntarily inevitably lapsed into falsehood
told truth hearers like himself often heard stories attacks formed definite idea attack expecting hear just such story would either believed still worse would thought rost himself blame since generally happens narrators cavalry attacks happened 
could tell simply everyone went trot fell off horse sprained arm ran hard could from frenchman into wood
besides tell everything really happenedwould been necessary make effort will tell only happened
very difficult tell truth young people are rarely capable 
hearers expected story beside himself all aflame excitement flown like storm square cut way slashed right left saber tasted flesh fallen exhausted 
middle story just saying cannot imagine strange frenzy one experiences during attack prince andrew whom bor expecting entered room
prince andrew liked help young men flattered being asked assistance being well disposed toward bor managed please day before wished young man wanted

upon undivided tensely passionate attention whole mass men concentrated
handsome young emperor alexander uniform horse guards wearing cocked hat peaks front back pleasant face resonant though loud voice attracted everyone attention

standing before 
prince dolgor kov rapidly indistinctly explained weyrother plan flanking movement
prince andrew began reply state own plan might been good weyrother disadvantage weyrother already been approved
soon prince andrew began demonstrate defects latter merits own plan prince dolgor kov ceased listen gazed absent mindedly map prince andrew face
there will council war kut zov tonight though can say all there remarked dolgor kov

however think general kut zov come out said prince andrew
wish good luck success gentlemen added went out after shaking hands dolgor kov bil bin
way home prince andrew could refrain from asking kut zov sitting silently beside thought tomorrow battle
kut zov looked sternly adjutant after pause replied think battle will lost told count tolst asked tell emperor
think replied dear general engaged rice cutlets look after military matters yourself yes
answer got shortly after nine clock evening weyrother drove plans kut zov quarters where council war held
all commanders columns summoned commander chief exception prince bagrati declined come all there appointed time
weyrother full control proposed battle eagerness briskness presented marked contrast dissatisfied drowsy kut zov reluctantly played part chairman president council war
weyrother evidently felt himself head movement already become unrestrainable
like horse running downhill harnessed heavy cart
whether pulling being pushed did know rushed along headlong speed time consider movement might lead 
weyrother been twice evening enemy picket line reconnoiter personally twice emperors russian austrian report explain headquarters where dictated dispositions german now much exhausted arrived kut zov 
evidently busy even forgot polite commander chief
interrupted talked rapidly indistinctly without looking man addressing did reply questions put 
bespattered mud pitiful weary distracted air though same time haughty self confident
kut zov occupying nobleman castle modest dimensions near ostralitz
large drawing room become commander chief office gathered kut zov himself weyrother members council war
drinking tea only awaited prince bagrati begin council
last bagrati orderly came news prince could attend
prince andrew came inform commander chief availing himself permission previously given kut zov present council remained room
since prince bagrati coming may begin said weyrother hurriedly rising from seat going table enormous map environs spread out
kut zov uniform unbuttoned fat neck bulged over collar escaping sitting almost asleep low chair podgy old hands resting symmetrically arms
sound weyrother voice opened one eye effort
yes yes please already late said nodding head let droop again closed eye
first members council thought kut zov pretending sleepsounds nose emitted during reading followed proved commander chief moment absorbed far more serious matter than desire show contempt dispositions anything else engaged satisfying irresistible human need sleep
weyrother gesture man busy lose moment glanced kut zov having convinced himself asleep took paper loud monotonous voice began read out dispositions impending battle under heading also read out dispositions attack enemy position behind kobelnitz sokolnitz november 1805
dispositions very complicated difficult
began follows enemy left wing rests wooded hills right extends along kobelnitz sokolnitz behind ponds are there other hand our left wing far outflank right advantageous attack enemy latter wing especially occupy villages sokolnitz kobelnitz whereby can both fall flank pursue over plain between schlappanitz thuerassa forest avoiding defiles schlappanitz bellowitz cover enemy front
first column marches
read weyrother
generals seemed listen reluctantly difficult dispositions
tall fair haired general buxh wden stood leaning back against wall eyes fixed burning candle seemed listeneven wish thought listen
exactly opposite weyrother glistening wide open eyes fixed upon mustache twisted upwards sat ruddy milor dovich military pose elbows turned outwards hands knees shoulders raised
remained stubbornly silent gazing weyrother face only turned away eyes when austrian chief staff finished reading
milor dovich looked round significantly other generals
one could tell from significant look whether agreed disagreed satisfied arrangements
next weyrother sat count langeron subtle smile never left typically southern french face during whole time reading gazed delicate fingers rapidly twirled corners gold snuffbox portrait
middle one longest sentences stopped rotary motion snuffbox raised head inimical politeness lurking corners thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing say something
austrian general continuing read frowned angrily jerked elbows say can tell your views later now good look map listen
langeron lifted eyes expression perplexity turned round milor dovich seeking explanation meeting latter impressive meaningless gaze drooped eyes sadly again took twirling snuffbox
geography lesson muttered himself loud enough heard
przebysz wski respectful dignified politeness held hand ear toward weyrother air man absorbed attention
dohkt rov little man sat opposite weyrother assiduous modest mien stooping over outspread map conscientiously studied dispositions unfamiliar locality
asked weyrother several times repeat words clearly heard difficult names villages
when reading lasted more than hour over langeron again brought snuffbox rest without looking weyrother anyone particular began say difficult carry out such plan enemy position assumed known whereas perhaps known since enemy movement
langeron objections valid obvious their chief aim show general weyrother read dispositions much self confidence addressing school children fools men could teach something military matters
when monotonous sound weyrother voice ceased kut zov opened eye miller wakes when soporific drone mill wheel interrupted
listened langeron said remarking are still silly business quickly closed eye again let head sink still lower
langeron trying virulently possible sting weyrother vanity author military plan argued bonaparte might easily attack instead being attacked render whole plan perfectly worthless
weyrother met all objections firm contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand meet all objections might
could attack would done today said 
think powerless said langeron
forty thousand men most replied weyrother smile doctor whom old wife wishes explain treatment case
case inviting doom awaiting our attack said langeron subtly ironical smile again glancing round support milor dovich near 
milor dovich moment evidently thinking anything rather than generals disputing about
foi said tomorrow shall see all battlefield
weyrother again gave smile seemed say strange ridiculous meet objections from russian generals prove merely convinced himself also convinced sovereign emperors 
enemy quenched fires continual noise heard from camp said 
does mean either retreating only thing need fear changing position
smiled ironically
even also took position thuerassa merely saves great deal trouble all our arrangements minutest detail remain same

began prince andrew long been waiting opportunity express doubts
kut zov woke coughed heavily looked round generals
gentlemen dispositions tomorrow rather today past midnight cannot now altered said 
heard shall all our duty
before battle there nothing more important
paused than good sleep
moved rise
past midnight
council war prince andrew been able express opinion hoped left vague uneasy impression
whether dolgor kov weyrother kut zov langeron others did approve plan attack right did know
really possible kut zov state views plainly emperor possible account court personal considerations tens thousands lives life life thoughtmust risked yes very likely shall killed tomorrow thought
suddenly thought death whole series most distant most intimate memories rose imagination remembered last parting from father wife remembered days when first loved 
thought pregnancy felt sorry himself nervously emotional softened mood went out hut billeted nesv tski began walk down before 
night foggy through fog moonlight gleamed mysteriously
yes tomorrow tomorrow thought
tomorrow everything may over all memories will more none will meaning 
tomorrow perhaps even certainly presentiment first time shall show all can 
fancy pictured battle loss concentration fighting one point hesitation all commanders
happy moment toulon long waited presents itself last
firmly clearly expresses opinion kut zov weyrother emperors
all are struck justness views one undertakes carry out takes regiment division stipulates one interfere arrangements leads division decisive point gains victory alone
death suffering suggested another voice
prince andrew however did answer voice went dreaming triumphs
dispositions next battle are planned alone
nominally only adjutant kut zov staff does everything alone
next battle won alone
well asked other voice
before are ten times wounded killed betrayed well
well prince andrew answered himself don know will happen don want know can want want glory want known men want loved fault want want nothing live only 
yes alone shall never tell anyone god love nothingfame men esteem death wounds loss family fear nothing
precious dear many persons are father sister wife those dearest yet dreadful unnatural seems would give all once moment glory triumph over men love from men don know never shall know love men thought listened voices kut zov courtyard
voices those orderlies packing one voice probably coachman teasing kut zov old cook whom prince andrew knew called tit
saying tit say tit well returned old man
tit thresh bit said wag
devil called out voice drowned laughter orderlies servants
all same love value nothing triumph over all value mystic power glory floating above mist same night rost platoon skirmishing duty front bagrati detachment
hussars placed along line couples himself rode along line trying master sleepiness kept coming over 
enormous space our army campfires dimly glowing fog could seen behind front misty darkness
rost could see nothing peer would into foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there something black now little lights seemed glimmer where enemy ought now fancied only something own eyes
eyes kept closing fancy appeared now emperor now den sov now moscow memories again hurriedly opened eyes saw close before head ears horse riding sometimes when came within six paces black figures hussars distance still same misty darkness
might easily happen thought rost emperor will meet give order would other officer say find out there
there are many stories getting know officer just such chance way attaching himself gave place near would guard would tell truth would unmask deceivers order realize vividly love devotion sovereign rost pictured himself enemy deceitful german whom would only kill pleasure whom would slap face before emperor
suddenly distant shout aroused 
where yes skirmishing line

ask leave front may only chance seeing emperor
won long now before off duty
take another turn when get back general ask 
readjusted himself saddle touched horse ride once more round hussars

napoleon five morning still quite dark
troops center reserves bagrati right flank yet moved left flank columns infantry cavalry artillery first descend heights attack french right flank drive into bohemian mountains according plan already astir
smoke campfires into throwing everything superfluous made eyes smart
officers hurriedly drinking tea breakfasting soldiers munching biscuit beating tattoo their feet warm themselves gathering round fires throwing into flames remains sheds chairs tables wheels tubs everything did want could carry away 
austrian column guides moving out among russian troops served heralds advance
soon austrian officer showed himself near commanding officer quarters regiment began move soldiers ran from fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into carts got their muskets ready formed rank
officers buttoned their coats buckled their swords pouches moved along ranks shouting
train drivers orderlies harnessed packed wagons tied loads
adjutants battalion regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final instructions orders commissions baggage men remained behind monotonous tramp thousands feet resounded
column moved forward without knowing where unable from masses around smoke increasing fog see either place leaving going
soldier march hemmed borne along regiment much sailor ship
however far walked whatever strange unknown dangerous places reaches just sailor always surrounded same decks masts rigging ship soldier always around same comrades same ranks same sergeant major trich same company dog jack same commanders
sailor rarely cares know latitude ship sailing day battle heaven knows whence stern note all are conscious sounds moral atmosphere army announcing approach something decisive solemn awakening men unusual curiosity
day battle soldiers excitedly try get beyond interests their regiment listen intently look about eagerly ask concerning going around 
fog grown dense though growing light could see ten paces ahead
bushes looked like gigantic trees level ground like cliffs slopes
anywhere side one might encounter enemy invisible ten paces off
columns advanced long time always same fog descending ascending hills avoiding gardens enclosures going over new unknown ground nowhere encountering enemy
contrary soldiers became aware front behind all sides other russian columns moving same direction
every soldier felt glad know unknown place where going many more our men going 
there now rskies also gone past being said ranks
wonderful lot our troops gathered lads last night looked campfires there end 
regular moscow though none column commanders rode ranks talked men commanders saw council war out humor dissatisfied affair did exert themselves cheer men merely carried out orders yet troops marched gaily always when going into action especially attack
when marched about hour dense fog greater part men halt unpleasant consciousness dislocation blunder spread through ranks
such consciousness communicated very difficult define certainly communicated very surely flows rapidly imperceptibly irrepressibly water does creek
russian army been alone without allies might perhaps been long time before consciousness mismanagement became general conviction disorder readily naturally attributed stupid germans everyone convinced dangerous muddle been occasioned sausage eaters
why stopped way blocked already come against french one can hear 
hurry enough start now stand middle field without rhyme reason
all those damned germans muddling stupid devils yes send front fear crowding behind
now stand hungry
say shall soon clear say cavalry are blocking way said officer
those damned germans don know their own country said another
division are shouted adjutant riding 
eighteenth
why are should gone long ago now won get there till evening
stupid orders don themselves know are doing said officer rode off
general rode past shouting something angrily russian
tafa lafa jabbering one can make out said soldier mimicking general ridden away
shoot scoundrels ordered place before nine haven got halfway
fine orders being repeated different sides
feeling energy troops started began turn into vexation anger stupid arrangements germans
cause confusion austrian cavalry moving toward our left flank higher command found our center far separated from our rightflank cavalry all ordered turn back right
several thousand cavalry crossed front infantry wait
front altercation occurred between austrian guide russian general
general shouted demand cavalry should halted austrian argued higher command blame
after hour delay last moved descending hill
fog dispersing hill lay still more densely below where descending
front fog shot heard another first irregularly varying intervals trata
tat more more regularly rapidly action goldbach stream began
expecting come enemy down stream having stumbled fog hearing encouraging word from their commanders consciousness being late spreading through ranks above all being unable see anything front around thick fog russians exchanged shots enemy lazily advanced again halted receiving timely orders from officers adjutants wandered about fog those unknown surroundings unable find their own regiments
way action began first second third columns gone down into valley
fourth column kut zov stood pratzen heights
below where fight beginning there still thick fog higher ground clearing nothing could seen going front
whether all enemy forces supposed six miles away whether near sea mist one knew till after eight clock
nine clock morning
fog lay unbroken like sea down below higher village schlappanitz where napoleon stood marshals around quite light
above clear blue sky sun vast orb quivered like huge hollow crimson float surface milky sea mist
whole french army even napoleon himself staff far side streams hollows sokolnitz schlappanitz beyond intended take our position begin action side close our own forces napoleon naked eye could distinguish mounted man from one foot
napoleon blue cloak worn italian campaign sat small gray arab horse little front marshals
gazed silently hills seemed rise out sea mist russian troops moving distance listened sounds firing valley
single muscle face those days still thin moved
gleaming eyes fixed intently one spot
predictions being justified
part russian force already descended into valley toward ponds lakes part leaving pratzen heights intended attack regarded key position
saw over misthollow between two hills near village pratzen russian columns their bayonets glittering moving continuously one direction toward valley disappearing one after another into mist
from information received evening before from sound wheels footsteps heard outposts during night disorderly movement russian columns from all indications saw clearly allies believed far away front columns moving near pratzen constituted center russian army center already sufficiently weakened successfully attacked
still did begin engagement
today great day anniversary coronation
before dawn slept few hours refreshed vigorous good spirits mounted horse rode out into field happy mood everything seems possible everything succeeds
sat motionless looking heights visible above mist cold face wore special look confident self complacent happiness one sees face boy happily love
marshals stood behind venturing distract attention
looked now pratzen heights now sun floating out mist
when sun entirely emerged from fog fields mist aglow dazzling light only awaited beginaction drew glove from shapely white hand made sign marshals ordered action begin
marshals accompanied adjutants galloped off different directions few minutes later chief forces french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights being more more denuded russian troops moving down valley their left
eight clock kut zov rode pratzen head fourth column milor dovich one take place przebysz wski langeron columns already gone down into valley
greeted men foremost regiment gave order march thereby indicating intended lead column himself
when reached village pratzen halted
prince andrew behind among immense number forming commander chief suite
state suppressed excitement irritation though controlledly calm man approach long awaited moment
firmly convinced day toulon bridge arcola
would come about did know felt sure would 
locality position our troops known far could known anyone our army
own strategic plan obviously could now carried out forgotten
now entering into weyrother plan prince andrew considered possible contingencies formed new projects such might call rapidity perception decision
left down below mist musketry fire unseen forces could heard
there prince andrew thought fight would concentrate
there shall encounter difficulties there thought shall sent brigade division there standard hand shall forward break whatever front 
could look calmly standards passing battalions
seeing kept thinking may very standard shall lead army
morning all left night mist heights hoar frost now turning dew valleys still lay like milk white sea
nothing visible valley left into our troops descended from whence came sounds firing
above heights dark clear sky right vast orb sun
front far off farther shore sea mist wooded hills discernible there enemy probably something could descried
right guards entering misty region sound hoofs wheels now gleam bayonets left beyond village similar masses cavalry came disappeared sea mist
commander chief standing end village letting troops pass 
infantry passing before came halt without command being given apparently obstructed something front
order form into battalion columns round village said angrily general ridden

kut zov laughed bitterly

dear fellow nesv tski whispered prince andrew old man surly dog
austrian officer white uniform green plumes hat galloped kut zov asked emperor name fourth column advanced into action
kut zov turned round without answering eye happened fall upon prince andrew beside 
seeing kut zov malevolent caustic expression softened admitting being done adjutant fault still answering austrian adjutant addressed bolk nski
dear fellow see whether third division passed village
hardly prince andrew started than stopped 
ask whether sharpshooters been posted added
are doing are doing murmured himself still replying austrian
prince andrew galloped off execute order
overtaking battalions continued advance stopped third division convinced himself there really sharpshooters front our columns
colonel head regiment much surprised commander chief order throw out skirmishers
felt perfectly sure there other troops front enemy must least six miles away
there really nothing seen front except barren descent hidden dense mist
having given orders commander chief name rectify omission prince andrew galloped back
kut zov still same place stout body resting heavily saddle lassitude age sat yawning wearily closed eyes
troops longer moving stood butts their muskets ground
all right all right said prince andrew turned general watch hand saying time started all left flank columns already descended
plenty time your excellency muttered kut zov midst yawn
just distance behind kut zov heard sound regiments saluting sound rapidly came nearer along whole extended line advancing russian columns
evidently person greeting riding quickly
when soldiers regiment front kut zov standing began shout rode little one side looked round frown
along road from pratzen galloped looked like squadron horsemen various uniforms
two rode side side front full gallop
oneblack uniform white plumes hat rode bobtailed chestnut horse other white uniform rode black one
two emperors followed their suites
kut zov affecting manners old soldier front gave command attention rode emperors salute
put air subordinate obeys without reasoning
affectation respect evidently struck alexander unpleasantly rode saluted
unpleasant impression merely flitted over young happy face emperor like cloud haze across clear sky vanished
after illness looked rather thinner day than field olm where bolk nski seen first time abroad there still same bewitching combination majesty mildness fine gray eyes delicate lips same capacity varying expression same prevalent appearance goodhearted innocent youth
olm review seemed more majestic seemed brighter more energetic
slightly flushed after galloping two miles reining horse sighed restfully looked round faces suite young animated own
czartor ski novos ltsev prince volk nsky str gonov others all richly dressed gay young men splendid well groomed fresh only slightly heated horses exchanging remarks smiling stopped behind emperor
emperor francis rosy long faced young man sat very erect handsome black horse looking about leisurely preoccupied manner
beckoned one white adjutants asked question most likely asking clock started thought prince andrew watching old acquaintance smile could repress recalled reception 
emperors suite picked young orderly officers guard line regiments russian austrian

emperor suite all exchanged rapid looks expressed dissatisfaction reproach
old though may should certainly should speak like their glances seemed say
tsar looked intently observantly into kut zov eye waiting hear whether would say anything more
kut zov respectfully bowed head seemed also waiting
silence lasted about minute
however command your majesty said kut zov lifting head again assuming former tone dull unreasoning submissive general
touched horse having called milor dovich commander column gave order advance
troops again began move two battalions vgorod one psheron regiment went forward past emperor
psheron battalion marched red faced milor dovich without greatcoat orders breast enormous tuft plumes cocked hat worn one side corners front back galloped strenuously forward dashing salute reined horse before emperor
god general said emperor
foi sire nous ferons qui sera dans notre possibilit sire answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among gentlemen tsar suite poor french
milor dovich wheeled horse sharply stationed himself little behind emperor
psheron men excited tsar presence passed step before emperors their suites bold brisk pace

emperor horse started sudden cry
horse carried sovereign reviews russia bore also field austerlitz enduring heedless blows left foot pricking ears sound shots just done empress field understanding significance firing nor nearness emperor francis black cob nor all being said thought felt day rider
emperor turned smile one followers made remark pointing gallant psherons
kut zov accompanied adjutants rode walking pace behind carabineers
when gone less than half mile rear column stopped solitary deserted house probably once been inn where two roads parted
bothled downhill troops marching along both
fog begun clear enemy troops already dimly visible about mile half off opposite heights
down below left firing became more distinct
kut zov stopped speaking austrian general
prince andrew little behind looking turned adjutant ask field glass
look look said adjutant looking troops distance down hill before 
french two generals adjutant took hold field glass trying snatch from one another
expression all their faces suddenly changed one horror
french supposed mile half away suddenly unexpectedly appeared just front 
enemy 
said different voices
naked eye prince andrew saw below right more than five hundred paces from where kut zov standing dense french column coming meet psherons
decisive moment arrived
turn come thought prince andrew striking horse rode kut zov
psherons must stopped your excellency cried 
very instant cloud smoke spread all round firing heard quite close hand voice terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted brothers all lost command everyone began run
confused ever increasing crowds running back where five minutes before troops passed emperors
only would been difficult stop crowd even impossible carried back oneself
bolk nski only tried lose touch looked around bewildered unable grasp happening front 
nesv tski angry face red unlike himself shouting kut zov did ride away once would certainly taken prisoner
kut zov remained same place without answering drew out handkerchief
blood flowing from cheek
are wounded asked hardly able master trembling lower jaw
wound there said kut zov pressing handkerchief wounded cheek pointing fleeing soldiers
stop shouted same moment probably realizing impossible stop spurred horse rode right
fresh wave flying mob caught bore back 
troops running such dense mass once surrounded difficult get out again
one shouting get why are hindering another same place turned round fired air third striking horse kut zov himself rode
having great effort got away left from flood men kut zov suite diminished more than half rode toward sound artillery fire near 
having forced way out crowd fugitives prince andrew trying keep near kut zov saw slope hill amid smoke russian battery still firing frenchmen running toward 
higher stood russian infantry neither moving forward protect battery nor backward fleeing crowd
mounted general separated himself from infantry approached kut zov
kut zov suite only four remained
all pale exchanged looks silence
stop those wretches gasped kut zov regimental commander pointing flying soldiers instant punish those words bullets flew hissing across regiment across kut zov suite like flock little birds
french attacked battery seeing kut zov firing 
after volley regimental commander clutched leg several soldiers fell second lieutenant holding flag let fall from hands
swayed fell caught muskets nearest soldiers
groaned kut zov despairingly looked around
bolk nski whispered voice trembling from consciousness feebleness age bolk nski whispered pointing disordered battalion enemy before finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears shame anger choking already leapt from horse run standard
forward lads shouted voice piercing child 
thought seizing staff standard hearing pleasure whistle bullets evidently aimed 
hurrah shouted prince andrew scarcely able hold heavy standard ran forward full confidence whole battalion would follow 
really only ran few steps alone
one soldier moved another soon whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah overtook 
sergeant battalion ran took flag swaying from weight prince andrew hands immediately killed
prince andrew again seized standard dragging staff ran battalion
front saw our artillerymen whom fighting others having abandoned their guns running toward 
also saw french infantry soldiers seizing artillery horses turning guns round
prince andrew battalion already within twenty paces cannon
heard whistle bullets above unceasingly right left soldiers continually groaned dropped
did look looked only going front battery
now saw clearly figure red haired gunner shako knocked awry pulling one end mop french soldier tugged other
could distinctly see distraught yet angry expression faces two men evidently did realize doing
are about thought prince andrew gazed 
why doesn red haired gunner run away unarmed why doesn frenchman stab will get away before frenchman remembers bayonet stabs 
really another french soldier trailing musket ran struggling men fate red haired gunner triumphantly secured mop still did realize awaited about decided
seemed though one soldiers near hit head full swing bludgeon
hurt little worst pain distracted prevented seeing been looking 
falling legs are giving way thought fell back
opened eyes hoping see struggle frenchmen gunners ended whether red haired gunner been killed whether cannon been captured saved
saw nothing
above there now nothing sky lofty sky clear yet still immeasurably lofty gray clouds gliding slowly across 
quiet peaceful solemn all ran thought prince andrew ran shouting fighting all gunner frenchman frightened angry faces struggled mop differently those clouds glide across lofty infinite skydid see lofty skybefore happy found last yes all vanity all falsehood except infinite sky
even does exist there nothing quiet peace
our right flank commanded bagrati nine clock battle yet begun
wishing agree dolgor kov demand commence action wishing avert responsibility from himself prince bagrati proposed dolgor kov send inquire commander chief
bagrati knew distance between two flanks more than six miles even messenger killed very likely would found commander chief would very difficult would able get back before evening
bagrati cast large expressionless sleepy eyes round suite boyish face rost breathless excitement hope first catch eye
should meet majesty before meet commander chief your excellency said rost hand cap
can give message majesty said dolgor kov hurriedly interrupting bagrati 
being relieved from picket duty rost managed get few hours sleep before morning felt cheerful bold resolute elasticity movement faith good fortune generally state mind makes everything seem possible pleasant easy
all wishes being fulfilled morning there general engagement taking part more than orderly bravest general still more going message kut zov perhaps even sovereign himself
morning bright good horse under heart full joy happiness
receiving order gave horse rein galloped along line
first rode along line bagrati troops yet advanced into action standing motionless came region occupied rov cavalry noticed stir signs preparation battle having passed rov cavalry clearly heard sound cannon musketry ahead 
firing grew louderlouder
fresh morning air now heard two three musket shots irregular intervals before followed one two cannon shots roll volleys musketry from slopes hill before pratzen interrupted such frequent reports cannon sometimes several separated from one another merged into general roar
could see puffs musketry smoke seemed chase one anotherdown hillsides clouds cannon smoke rolling spreading mingling one another
could also gleam bayonets visible through smoke make out moving masses infantry narrow lines artillery green caissons
rost stopped horse moment hillock see going strain attention would could understand make outanything happening there smoke men sort moving about front behind moved lines troops why whither impossible make out
sights sounds depressing intimidating effect contrary stimulated energy determination
give mentally exclaimed sounds again proceeded gallop along line penetrating farther farther into region where army already action
will there don know all will well thought rost 
after passing austrian troops noticed next part line guards already action
much better shall see close thought
riding almost along front line
handful men came galloping toward 
our uhlans disordered ranks returning from attack
rost got out their way involuntarily noticed one bleeding galloped 
business mine thought
ridden many hundred yards after before saw left across whole width field enormous mass cavalry brilliant white uniforms mounted black horses trotting straight toward across path
rost put horse full gallop get out way men would got clear continued same speed kept increasing their pace horses already galloping
rost heard thud their hoofs jingle their weapons saw their horses their figures even their faces more more distinctly
our horse guards advancing attack french cavalry coming meet 
horse guards galloping still holding their horses
rost could already see their faces heard command charge shouted officer urging thoroughbred full speed
rost fearing crushed swept into attack french galloped along front hard horse could still time avoid 
last horse guards huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily seeing rost before whom would inevitably collide
guardsman would certainly bowled rost bedouin over rost felt himself quite tiny weak compared gigantic men horses occurred rost flourish whip before eyes guardsman horse
heavy black horse sixteen hands high shied throwing back ears pockmarked guardsman drove huge spurs violently horse flourishing tail extending neck galloped yet faster
hardly horse guards passed rost before heard shout hurrah looking back saw their foremost ranks mixed foreign cavalry red epaulets probably french
could see nothing more immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere smoke enveloped everything
moment horse guards having passed disappeared smoke rost hesitated whether gallop after where sent
brilliant charge horse guards amazed french themselves
rost horrified hear later all mass huge handsome men all those brilliant rich youths officers cadets galloped past their thousand ruble horses only eighteen left after charge
why should envy chance lost maybe shall see emperor immediately thought rost galloped 
when came level foot guards noticed about around cannon balls flying aware much heard their sound saw uneasiness soldiers faces unnatural warlike solemnity those officers
passing behind one lines regiment foot guards heard voice calling name
rost answered recognizing bor 
say been front line our regiment attacked said bor happy smile seen faces young men been under fire first time
rost stopped
said
well did drove back said bor animation growing talkative
can imagine began describing guards having taken their position seeing troops before thought austrians all once discovered from cannon balls discharged those troops themselves front line unexpectedly into action
rost without hearing bor end spurred horse
where are off asked bor 
message majesty
there said bor thinking rost said highness pointing grand duke high shoulders frowning brows stood hundred paces away from helmet horse guards jacket shouting something pale white uniformed austrian officer
grand duke want commander chief emperor said rost about spur horse
count count shouted berg ran from other side eager bor 
count wounded right hand showed bleeding hand handkerchief tied round remained front
held sword left hand count
all our family von bergs been knights said something more rost did wait hear rode away
having passed guards traversed empty space rost avoid again getting front first line done when horse guards charged followed line reserves going far round place where hottest musket fire cannonade heard
suddenly heard musket fire quite close front behind our troops where could never expected enemy 
can thought
enemy rear our army impossible suddenly seized panic fear himself issue whole battle
may reflected there riding round now
must look commander chief all lost perish rest
foreboding evil suddenly come over rost more more confirmed farther rode into region behind village pratzen full troops all kinds
does mean whom are firing firing rost kept asking came russian austrian soldiers running confused crowds across path
devil knows killed everybody all now told russian german czech crowd fugitives understood happening little did
kill germans shouted one
may devil take traitors zum henker diese russen muttered german
several wounded men passed along road words abuse screams groans mingled general hubbub firing died down
rost learned later russian austrian soldiers been firing one another
god does all mean thought 
where moment emperor may see 
must only handful scoundrels
will soon over can can only get past quicker quicker idea defeat flight could enter rost head
though saw french cannon french troops pratzen heights just where been ordered look commander chief could did wish believe 
rost been ordered look kut zov emperor near village pratzen
neither nor single commanding officer there only disorganized crowds troops various kinds
urged already weary horse get quickly past crowds farther went more disorganized 
highroad come out thronged cal ches carriages all sorts russian austrian soldiers all arms wounded 
whole mass droned jostled confusion under dismal influence cannon balls flying from french batteries stationed pratzen heights
where emperor where kut zov rost kept asking everyone could stop got answer from anyone
last seizing soldier collar forced answer
brother all bolted long ago said soldier laughing reason shaking himself free
having left soldier evidently drunk rost stopped horse batman groom important personage began question 
man announced tsar been driven carriage full speed about hour before along very road dangerously wounded
can said rost 
saw myself replied man self confident smile derision
ought know emperor now after times seen petersburg
there sat carriage pale anything
made four black horses fly gracious did rattle past time knew imperial horses ily nych
don think ily drives anyone except tsar rost let horse about ride when wounded officer passing addressed want asked
commander chief killed cannon ball struck breast before our regiment
killed wounded another officer corrected 
kut zov asked rost 
kut zov name well never mind
there are many left alive
way village all commanders are there said officer pointing village hosjeradek walked 
rost rode footpace knowing why whom now going
emperor wounded battle lost
impossible doubt now
rost rode direction pointed out saw turrets church
need hurry now say tsar kut zov even alive unwounded take road your honor way will killed once soldier shouted 
kill there are talking about said another
where way nearer
rost considered went direction where said would killed
all same now
emperor wounded try save myself thought
rode region where greatest number men perished fleeing from pratzen
french yet occupied region russians uninjured slightly wounded left long ago
all about field like heaps manure well kept plowland lay from ten fifteen dead wounded each couple acres
wounded crept together twos threes one could hear their distressing screams groans sometimes feigned seemed rost 
put horse trot avoid seeing all suffering men felt afraid afraid life courage needed knew would stand sight unfortunates
french ceased firing field strewn dead wounded where there one left fire seeing adjutant riding over trained gun fired several shots
sensation those terrible whistling sounds corpses around merged rost mind into single feeling terror pity himself
remembered mother last letter
would feel thought saw now field cannon aimed village hosjeradek there russian troops retiring from field battle though still confusion less disordered
french cannon did reach there musketry fire sounded far away
everyone clearly saw said battle lost
one whom rost asked could tell where emperor kut zov 
said report emperor wounded correct others explained false rumor spread fact emperor carriage really galloped from field battle pale terrified ober hofmarschal count tolst ridden out battlefield others emperor suite
one officer told rost seen someone from headquarters behind village left thither rost rode hoping find anyone merely ease conscience
when ridden about two miles passed last russian troops saw near kitchen garden ditchround two men horseback facing ditch
one white plume hat seemed familiar rost other beautiful chestnut horse rost fancied seen before rode ditch struck horse spurs giving rein leaped lightly over
only little earth crumbled from bank under horse hind hoofs
turning horse sharply again jumped ditch deferentially addressed horseman white plumes evidently suggesting should same
rider whose figure seemed familiar rost involuntarily riveted attention made gesture refusal head hand gesture rost instantly recognized lamented adored monarch
can alone midst empty field thought rost 
moment alexander turned head rost saw beloved features deeply engraved memory
emperor pale cheeks sunken eyes hollow charm mildness features all greater
rost happy assurance rumors about emperor being wounded false
happy seeing 
knew might even ought straight give message dolgor kov ordered deliver
youth love trembles unnerved dares utter thoughts dreamed nights looks around help chance delay flight when longed moment comes alone rost now attained longed more than anything else world did know approach emperor thousand reasons occurred why would inconvenient unseemly impossible 
glad chance take advantage being alone despondent strange face may seem unpleasant painful moment sorrow besides can say now when heart fails mouth feels dry mere sight one innumerable speeches addressed emperor composed imagination could now recall
those speeches intended quite other conditions most part spoken moment victory triumph generally when dying wounds sovereign thanked heroic deeds dying expressed love actions proved
besides can ask emperor instructions right flank now nearly four clock battle lost certainly must approach must intrude reflections
better die thousand times than risk receiving unkind look bad opinion from rost decided sorrowfully heart full despair rode away continually looking back tsar still remained same attitude indecision
rost thus arguing himself riding sadly away captain von toll chanced ride same spot seeing emperor once rode offered services assisted cross ditch foot
emperor wishing rest feeling unwell sat down under apple tree von toll remained beside 
rost from distance saw envy remorse von toll spoke long warmly emperor emperor evidently weeping covered eyes handpressed von toll hand
might been place thought rost hardly restraining tears pity emperor rode utter despair knowing where why now riding
despair all greater from feeling own weakness cause grief
might
only might should gone sovereign
unique chance show devotion emperor made use 
turned round galloped back place where seen emperor there one beyond ditch now
from one drivers learned kut zov staff far off village vehicles going 
front walked kut zov groom leading horses horsecloths
came cart behind walked old bandy legged domestic serf peaked cap sheepskin coat
tit say tit said groom

pratzen heights where fallen flagstaff hand lay prince andrew bolk nski bleeding profusely unconsciously uttering gentle piteous childlike moan
toward evening ceased moaning became quite still
did know long unconsciousness lasted
suddenly again felt alive suffering from burning lacerating pain head
where lofty sky did know till now saw today first thought
did know suffering either thought
yes did know anything anything all till now
where listened heard sound approaching horses voices speaking french
above again same lofty sky clouds risen floating still higher between gleamed blue infinity
did turn head did see those judging sound hoofs voices ridden stopped near 
napoleon accompanied two aides camp
bonaparte riding over battlefield given final orders strengthen batteries firing augesd dam looking killed wounded left field
fine men remarked napoleon looking dead russian grenadier face buried ground blackened nape lay stomach already stiffened arm flung wide
ammunition guns position exhausted your majesty said adjutant come from batteries firing augesd
brought from reserve said napoleon having gone few steps stopped before prince andrew lay back flagstaff been dropped beside 
flag already been taken french trophy
fine death said napoleon gazed bolk nski
prince andrew understood said napoleon said 
heard words might heard buzzing fly
only did interest took notice once forgot 
head burning felt himself bleeding death saw above remote lofty everlasting sky
knew napoleon hero moment napoleon seemed such small insignificant creature compared passing now between himself lofty infinite sky clouds flying over 
moment meant nothing might standing over said only glad people standing near only wished would help bring back life seemed beautiful now today learned understand differently
collected all strength stir utter sound
feebly moved leg uttered weak sickly groan aroused own pity
alive said napoleon
lift young man carry dressing station
having said napoleon rode meet marshal lannes hat hand rode smiling emperor congratulate victory
prince andrew remembered nothing more lost consciousness from terrible pain being lifted onto stretcher jolting being moved probing wound dressing station
did regain consciousness till late day when other wounded captured russian officers carried hospital
during transfer felt little stronger able look about even speak
first words heard coming senses those french convoy officer said rapidly must halt emperor will pass immediately will please see gentlemen prisoners
there are many prisoners today nearly whole russian army probably tired said another officer
all same say one commander all emperor alexander guardssaid first one indicating russian officer white uniform horse guards
bolk nski recognized prince repn whom met petersburg society
beside stood lad nineteen also wounded officer horse guards
bonaparte having come gallop stopped horse
senior asked seeing prisoners
named colonel prince repn 
are commander emperor alexander regiment horse guards asked napoleon
commanded squadron replied repn 
your regiment fulfilled duty honorably said napoleon
praise great commander soldier highest reward said repn 
bestow pleasure said napoleon
young man beside prince repn named lieutenant sukht len
after looking napoleon smiled
very young come meddle 
youth hindrance courage muttered sukht len failing voice
splendid reply said napoleon
young man will far prince andrew also been brought forward before emperor eyes complete show prisoners could fail attract attention
napoleon apparently remembered seeing battlefield addressing again used epithet young man connected memory prince andrew
well young man said 
feel mon brave though five minutes before prince andrew been able say few words soldiers carrying now eyes fixed straight napoleon silent
insignificant moment seemed all interests engrossed napoleon mean did hero himself paltry vanity joy victory appear compared lofty equitable kindly sky seen understood could answer 
everything seemed futile insignificant comparison stern solemn train thought weakness from loss blood suffering nearness death aroused 
looking into napoleon eyes prince andrew thought insignificance greatness unimportance life one could understand still greater unimportance death meaning one alive could understand explain
emperor without waiting answer turned away said one officers went gentlemen attended taken bivouac let doctor larrey examine their wounds
revoir prince repn spurred horse galloped away
face shone self satisfaction pleasure
soldiers carried prince andrew noticed taken little gold icon princess mary hung round brother neck seeing favor emperor showed prisoners now hastened return holy image
prince andrew did see whom replaced little icon thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon chest outside uniform
would good thought prince andrew glancing icon sister hung round neck such emotion reverence would good everything clear simple seems mary
good would know where seek help life expect after beyond grave happy calm should could now say lord mercy 
whom should say either power indefinable incomprehensible only cannot address cannot even express words great all nothing said himself god been sewn into amulet mary there nothing certain nothing all except unimportance everything understand greatness something incomprehensible all important
stretchers moved 
every jolt again felt unendurable pain feverishness increased grew delirious
visions father wife sister future son tenderness felt night before battle figure insignificant little napoleon above all lofty sky formed chief subjects delirious fancies
quiet home life peaceful happiness bald hills presented itself 
already enjoying happiness when little napoleon suddenly appeared unsympathizing look shortsighted delight misery others doubts torments followed only heavens promised peace
toward morning all dreams melted merged into chaos darkness unconciousness oblivion opinion napoleon doctor larrey much more likely end death than convalescence
nervous bilious subject said larrey will recover
prince andrew others fatally wounded left care inhabitants district

moment home life jokes tya talks nya duets nat sha piquet father even comfortable bed house povarsk rose before such vividness clearness charm seemed all lost unappreciated bliss long past
could conceive stupid chance letting seven dealt right rather than left might deprive all happiness newly appreciated newly illumined plunge into depths unknown undefined misery

lokhov longer listening stories telling followed every movement rost hands occasionally ran eyes over score against 
decided play until score reached forty three thousand
fixed number forty three sum nya joint ages
rost leaning head both hands sat table scrawled over figures wet spilled wine littered cards
one tormenting impression did leave those broad boned reddish hands hairy wrists visible from under shirt sleeves those hands loved hated held their power
six hundred rubles ace corner nine

rost just prepared card bending corner meant double three thousand just put down score when lokhov slamming down pack cards put aside began rapidly adding total rost debt breaking chalk marked figures clear bold hand

shriveled old hands folded finger one pierre noticed large cast iron ring seal representing death head

traveler joseph alex evich bazd pierre saw from postmaster book
bazd been one best known freemasons martinists even nov kov time
long after gone pierre did bed order horses paced down room pondering over vicious past rapturous sense beginning anew pictured himself blissful irreproachable virtuous future seemed easy
seemed been vicious only somehow forgotten good virtuous
trace former doubts remained soul
firmly believed possibility brotherhood men united aim supporting one another path virtue freemasonry presented itself 
reaching petersburg pierre did let anyone know arrival went nowhere spent whole days reading thomas kempis whose book been sent someone unknown
one thing continually realized read book joy hitherto unknown believing possibility attaining perfection possibility active brotherly love among men joseph alex evich revealed 
week after arrival young polish count willarski whom pierreknown slightly petersburg society came into room one evening official ceremonious manner lokhov second called having closed door behind satisfied himself there nobody else room addressed pierre

pierre inquiries must should answer willarski only replied brothers more worthy than would test pierre only tell truth
having entered courtyard large house where lodge headquarters having ascended dark staircase entered small well lit anteroom where took off their cloaks without aid servant
man strange attire appeared door
willarski stepping toward said something french undertone went small wardrobe pierre noticed garments such never seen before
having taken kerchief from cupboard willarski bound pierre eyes tied knotbehind catching hairs painfully knot
drew face down kissed taking hand led forward
hairs tied knot hurt pierre there lines pain face shamefaced smile
huge figure arms hanging down puckered though smiling face moved after willarski uncertain timid steps
having led about ten paces willarski stopped
whatever happens said must bear all manfully firmly resolved join our brotherhood
pierre nodded affirmatively
when hear knock door will uncover your eyes added willarski
wish courage success pressing pierre hand went out
left alone pierre went smiling same way
once twice shrugged shoulders raised hand kerchief wishing take off let drop again
five minutes spent eyes bandaged seemed hour
arms felt numb legs almost gave way seemed tired out
experienced variety most complex sensations
felt afraid would happen still more afraid showing fear
felt curious know going happen would revealed most all felt joyful moment come when would last start path regeneration actively virtuous life been dreaming since met joseph alex evich
loud knocks heard door
pierre took bandage off eyes glanced around 
room black darkness only small lamp burning inside something white
pierre went nearer saw lamp stood black table lay open book
book gospel white thing lamp inside human skull cavities teeth
after reading first words gospel beginning word word god pierre went round table saw large open box filled something
all surprised saw
hoping enter entirely new life quite unlike old one expected everything unusual even more unusual than seeing
skull coffin gospel seemed expected all even more
trying stimulate emotions looked around
god death love brotherhood man kept saying himself associating words vague yet joyful ideas
dim light pierre already become accustomed saw rather short man
having evidently come from light into darkness man paused moved cautious steps toward table placed small leather gloved hands
short man white leather apron covered chest part legs kind necklace above rose high white ruffle outlining rather long face lit from below
come hither asked newcomer turning pierre direction slight rustle made latter
why believe truth light seen light come seek from wisdom virtue enlightenment moment door opened stranger came pierre felt sense awe veneration such experienced boyhood confession felt himself presence one socially complete stranger yet nearer through brotherhood man
bated breath beating heart moved toward rhetor name brother prepared seeker entrance into brotherhood known 
drawing nearer recognized rhetor man knew smolyan nov mortified think newcomer acquaintance wished simply brother virtuous instructor
long time could utter word rhetor repeat question
yes
very well said smolyan nov went once idea means our holy order will help reach your aim said quietly quickly

regeneration said pierre trembling voice difficulty utterance due excitement being unaccustomed speak abstract matters russian
your conception freemasonry imagine freemasonry fraternity equality men virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed inadequacy words solemnity moment spoke
good said rhetor quickly apparently satisfied answer
sought means attaining your aim religion considered erroneous did follow said pierre softly rhetor did hear asked saying
been atheist answered pierre
are seeking truth order follow laws your life therefore seek wisdom virtue
said rhetor after moment pause
yes yes assented pierre
rhetor cleared throat crossed gloved hands breast began speak
now must disclose chief aim our order said aim coincides yours may enter our brotherhood profit
first chief object our order foundation rests human power can destroy preservation handing posterity certain important mystery
come down from remotest ages even from first man mystery perhaps fate mankind depends
since mystery such nature nobody can know use unless prepared long diligent self purification everyone can hope attain quickly
hence secondary aim preparing our members much possible reform their hearts purify enlighten their minds means handed tradition from those striven attain mystery thereby render capable receiving 
purifying regenerating our members try thirdly improve whole human race offering our members example piety virtue thereby try all our might combat evil sways world
think over will come again
combat evil sways world
pierre repeated mental image future activity direction rose mind
imagined men such himself been fortnight ago addressed edifying exhortation 
imagined himself vicious unfortunate people whom would assist word deed imagined oppressors whose victims would rescue
three objects mentioned rhetor last improving mankind especially appealed pierre
important mystery mentioned rhetor though aroused curiosity did seem essential second aim purifying regenerating himself did much interest moment felt delight already perfectly cured former faults ready all good
half hour later rhetor returned inform seeker seven virtues corresponding seven steps solomon temple every freemason should cultivate himself
discretion keeping secrets order
obedience those higher ranks order
seventh place try frequent thought death rhetor said bring yourself regard dreaded foe friend frees soul grown weary labors virtue from distressful life leads place recompense peace
yes must thought pierre when after words rhetor went away leaving solitary meditation
must still weak love life meaning only now gradually opening before 
five other virtues pierre recalled counting fingers felt already soul courage generosity morality love mankind especially obedience did even seem virtue joy
now felt glad free from own lawlessness submit will those knew indubitable truth
forgot seventh virtue could recall 
third time rhetor came back more quickly asked pierre whether still firm intention determined submit all would required 
ready everything said pierre
must also inform said rhetor our order delivers teaching wordsonly also other means may perhaps stronger effect sincere seeker after wisdom virtue than mere words
chamber see therein should already suggested your heart sincere more than words could 
will perhaps also see your further initiation like method enlightenment
our order imitates ancient societies explained their teaching hieroglyphics
hieroglyph said rhetor emblem something cognizable senses possesses qualities resembling those symbol
pierre knew very well hieroglyph dared speak
listened rhetor silence feeling from all said ordeal about begin
are resolved must begin your initiation said rhetor coming closer pierre
token generosity ask give all your valuables
nothing replied pierre supposing asked give all possessed
watch money rings
pierre quickly took out purse watch could manage time get wedding ring off fat finger
when been done rhetor said token obedience ask undress
pierre took off coat waistcoat left boot according rhetor instructions
mason drew shirt back from pierre left breast stooping down pulled left leg trousers above knee
pierre hurriedly began taking off right boot also going tuck other trouser leg save stranger trouble mason told necessary gave slipper left foot
childlike smile embarrassment doubt self derision appeared face against will pierre stood arms hanging down legs apart before brother rhetor awaited further commands
now token candor ask reveal your chief passion said latter
passion many replied pierre
passion more than all others caused waver path virtue said mason
pierre paused seeking reply
wine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women went over vices mind knowing give pre eminence
women said low scarcely audible voice
mason did move long time said nothing after answer
last moved pierre taking kerchief lay table again bound eyes
last time say turn all your attention upon yourself put bridle your senses seek blessedness passion your own heart
source blessedness without within
pierre already long been feeling himself refreshing source blessedness now flooded heart glad emotion
soon after there came into dark chamber fetch pierre rhetor pierre sponsor willarski whom recognized voice
fresh questions firmness resolution pierre replied yes yes agree beaming childlike smile fat chestuncovered stepping unevenly timidly one slippered one booted foot advanced willarski held sword bare chest
conducted from room along passages turned backwards forwards last brought doors lodge
willarski coughed answered masonic knock mallets doors opened before 
bass voice pierre still blindfolded questioned when where born 
again led somewhere still blindfolded went along told allegories toils pilgrimage holy friendship eternal architect universe courage should endure toils dangers
during wanderings pierre noticed spoken now seeker now sufferer now postulant accompaniment various knockings mallets swords
being led object noticed hesitation uncertainty among conductors
heard those around disputing whispers one insisting should led along certain carpet
after took right hand placed something told hold pair compasses left breast other hand repeat after someone read aloud oath fidelity laws order
candles extinguished spirit lighted pierre knew smell told would now see lesser light
bandage taken off eyes faint light burning spirit pierre dream saw several men standing before wearing aprons like rhetor holding swords their hands pointed breast
among stood man whose white shirt stained blood
seeing pierre moved forward breast toward swords meaning pierce 
swords drawn back from once blindfolded again
now thou hast seen lesser light uttered voice
candles relit told would see full light bandage again removed more than ten voices said together sic transit gloria mundi
pierre gradually began recover himself looked about room people 
round long table covered black sat twelve men garments like those already seen
pierre met petersburg society
president chair sat young man did know peculiar cross hanging from neck
right sat italian abb whom pierre met anna vlovna two years before
there also present very distinguished dignitary swiss formerly been tutor kur gins 
all maintained solemn silence listening words president held mallet hand
let into wall star shaped light
one side table small carpet various figures worked upon other something resembling altar lay testament skull
round stood seven large candlesticks like those used churches
two brothers led pierre altar placed feet right angles bade lie down saying must prostrate himself gates temple
must first receive trowel whispered one brothers
hush please said another
pierre perplexed looked round shortsighted eyes without obeying suddenly doubts arose mind
where doing aren laughing shan ashamed remember doubts only lasted moment
pierre glanced serious faces those around remembered all already gone through realized could stop halfway
aghast hesitation trying arouse former devotional feeling prostrated himself before gates temple
really feeling devotion returned even more strongly than before
when lain there time told get white leather apron such others wore put given trowel three pairs gloves grand master addressed 
told should try nothing stain whiteness apron symbolized strength purity unexplained trowel told toil cleanse own heart from vice indulgently smooth heart neighbor
first pair gloves man said pierre could know their meaning must keep 
second pair man gloves wear meetings finally third pair women gloves said dear brother woman gloves are intended 
give woman whom shall honor most all
gift will pledge your purity heart whom select your worthy helpmeet masonry
after pause added beware dear brother gloves deck hands are unclean
grand master said last words seemed pierre grew embarrassed
pierre himself grew still more confused blushed like child till tears came eyes began looking about uneasily awkward pause followed
silence broken one brethren led pierre rug began reading from manuscript book explanation all figures sun moon hammer plumb line trowel rough stone squared stone pillar three windows 
place assigned pierre shown signs lodge told password last permitted sit down
grand master began reading statutes
very long pierre from joy agitation embarrassment state understand being read
managed follow only last words statutes remained mind
our temples recognize other distinctions read grand master those between virtue vice
beware making distinctions may infringe equality
fly brotheraid whoever may exhort goeth astray raise falleth never bear malice enmity toward thy brother
kindle all hearts flame virtue
share thy happiness thy neighbor may envy never dim purity bliss

soon after admission masonic brotherhood pierre went kiev province where greatest number serfs taking full directions written down own guidance should estates
when reached kiev sent all stewards head office explained intentions wishes
told steps would taken immediately free serfs till overburdened labor women nursing their babies sent work assistance given serfs punishments admonitory corporal hospitals asylums schools established all estates
stewards there semiliterate foremen among listened alarm supposing words mean young count displeased their management embezzlement money after their first fright amused pierre lisp new words heard before others simply enjoyed hearing master talked cleverest among including chief steward understood from speech could best handle master their own ends
chief steward expressed great sympathy pierre intentions remarked besides changes would necessary into general state affairs far from satisfactory
despite count bez khov enormous wealth since come into income said amount five hundred thousand rublesyear pierre felt himself far poorer than when father made allowance ten thousand rubles
dim perception following budget about 000 went payments all estates land bank about 000 went upkeep estate near moscow town house allowance three princesses about 000 given pensions same amount asylums 150 000 alimony sent countess about 000 went interest debts
building new church previously begun cost about 000 each last two years did know rest about 100 000 rubles spent almost every year obliged borrow
besides chief steward wrote every year telling fires bad harvests necessity rebuilding factories workshops
first task pierre face one very little aptitude inclination practical business
discussed estate affairs every day chief steward
felt did forward matters all
felt consultations detached from real affairs did link make move
one hand chief steward put state things very worst light pointing out necessity paying off debts undertaking new activities serf labor pierre did agree
other hand pierre demanded steps should taken liberate serfs steward met showing necessity first paying off loans from land bank consequent impossibility speedy emancipation
steward did say quite impossible suggested selling forests province kostrom land lower down river crimean estate order make possible all operations according connected such complicated measures removal injunctions petitions permits pierre became quite bewildered only replied yes yes 
pierre none practical persistence would enabled attend business himself disliked only tried pretend steward attending 
steward part tried pretend count considered consultations very valuable proprietor troublesome himself
kiev pierre found people knew strangers hastened make acquaintance joyfully welcomed rich newcomer largest landowner province
temptations pierre greatest weakness one confessed when admitted lodge strong could resist 
again whole days weeks months life passed great rush much occupied evening parties dinners lunches balls giving time reflection petersburg
instead new life hoped lead still lived old life only new surroundings
three precepts freemasonry pierre realized did fulfill one enjoined every mason set example moral life seven virtues lacked two morality love death
consoled himself thought fulfilled another precepts reforming human race other virtues love neighbor especially generosity
spring 1807 decided return petersburg
way intended visit all estates see himself far orders been carried out state serfs whom god entrusted care whom intended benefit
chief steward considered young count attempts almost insane unprofitable himself count serfs made concessions
continuing represent liberation serfs impracticable arranged erection large buildings schools hospitals asylums all estates before master arrived
everywhere preparations made ceremonious welcomes knew pierre would like just such gratefully religious ones offerings icons bread salt hospitality according understanding master would touch delude 
southern spring comfortable rapid traveling vienna carriage solitude road all gladdening effect pierre
estates before visited each more picturesque than other serfs everywhere seemed thriving touchingly grateful benefits conferred 
everywhere receptions though embarrassed pierre awakened joyful feeling depth heart
one place peasants presented bread salt icon saint peter saint paul asking permission mark their gratitude benefits conferred build new chantry church their own expense honor peter paul patron saints
another place women infants arms met thank releasing from hard work
third estate priest bearing cross came meet surrounded children whom count generosity instructing reading writing religion
all estates pierre saw own eyes brick buildings erected course erection all one plan hospitals schools almshouses soon opened
everywhere saw stewards accounts according serfs manorial labor been diminished heard touching thanks deputations serfs their full skirted blue coats
pierre did know place where presented bread salt wished build chantry honor peter paul market village where fair held 
peter day richest peasants formed deputation begun chantry long before nine tenths peasants villages state greatest poverty
did know since nursing mothers longer sent work landdid still harder work their own land
did know priest met cross oppressed peasants exactions pupils parents wept having let take their children secured their release heavy payments
did know brick buildings built plan being built serfs whose manorial labor thus increased though lessened paper
did know where steward shown accounts serfs payments been diminished third their obligatory manorial work been increased half
pierre delighted visit estates quite recovered philanthropic mood left petersburg wrote enthusiastic letters brother instructor called grand master
easy little effort needs much good thought pierre little attention pay pleased gratitude received felt abashed receiving 
gratitude reminded much more might simple kindly people
chief steward very stupid cunning man saw perfectly through intelligent count played toy seeing effect prearranged receptions pierre pressed still harder proofs impossibility above all uselessness freeing serfs quite happy 
pierre secret soul agreed steward would difficult imagine happier people god only knew would happen when free insisted though reluctantly thought right
steward promised all power carry out count wishes seeing clearly only would count never able find out whether all measures been taken sale land forests release from land bank would probably never even inquire would never know newly erected buildings standing empty serfs continued give money work all other people serfs gave say all could got out

prince andrew spent two years continuously country
all plans pierre attempted estates constantly changing from one thing another never accomplished carried out prince andrew without display without perceptible difficulty
highest degree practical tenacity pierre lacked without fuss strain part set things going
one estates three hundred serfs liberated became free agricultural laborers being one first examples kind russia
other estates serfs compulsory labor commuted quitrent
trained midwife engaged boguch rovo expense priest paid teach reading writing children peasants household serfs
prince andrew spent half time bald hills father son still care nurses
other half spent boguch rovo cloister father called prince andrew estate
despite indifference affairsworld expressed pierre diligently followed all went received many books surprise noticed when father visitors from petersburg very vortex life people lagged behind himself never left country knowledge happening home foreign affairs
besides being occupied estates reading great variety books prince andrew time busy critical survey our last two unfortunate campaigns drawing proposal reform army rules regulations
spring 1809 went visit ryaz estates been inherited son whose guardian 
warmed spring sunshine sat cal che looking new grass first leaves birches first puffs white spring clouds floating across clear blue sky
thinking anything looked absent mindedly cheerfully from sideside
crossed ferry where talked pierre year before
went through muddy village past threshing floors green fields winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near bridge uphill where clay been liquefied rain past strips stubble land bushes touched green there into birch forest growing both sides road
forest almost hot wind could felt
birches their sticky green leavesmotionless lilac colored flowers first blades green grass pushing lifting last year leaves
coarse evergreen color small fir trees scattered there among birches unpleasant reminder winter
entering forest horses began snort sweated visibly
peter footman made remark coachman latter assented
apparently coachman sympathy enough peter turned box toward master
pleasant your excellency said respectful smile
pleasant your excellency talking about thought prince andrew
spring suppose thought turned round
yes really everything green already
early birches cherry alders are coming out
one oakedge road stood oak
probably ten times age birches formed forest ten times thick twice tall 
enormous tree girth twice great man could embrace evidently long ago branches been broken off bark scarred
huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically gnarled hands fingers stood aged stern scornful monster among smiling birch trees
only dead looking evergreen firs dotted about forest oak refused yield charm spring notice either spring sunshine
spring love happiness oak seemed say
are weary stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always same always fraud there spring sun happiness look those cramped dead firs ever same sticking out broken barked fingers just where grown whether from back sides grown stand believe your hopes your lies
passed through forest prince andrew turned several times look oak expecting something from 
under oak flowers grass stood among scowling rigid misshapen grim ever
yes oak right thousand times right thought prince andrew
let others young yield afresh fraud know life our life finished whole sequence new thoughts hopeless mournfully pleasant rose soul connection tree
during journey considered life afresh arrived old conclusion restful hopelessness begin anythinganew must live out life content harm disturbing himself desiring anything
prince andrew see marshal nobility district connection affairs ryaz estate trustee
marshal count ily rost middle may prince andrew went visit 
now hot spring weather
whole forest already clothed green
dusty hot passing near water one longed bathe
prince andrew depressed preoccupied business about speak marshal driving avenue grounds rost house otr dnoe
heard merry girlish cries behind trees right saw group girls running cross path cal che
ahead rest nearer ran dark haired remarkably slim pretty girl yellow chintz dress white handkerchief head from under loose locks hair escaped
girl shouting something seeing stranger ran back laughing without looking 
suddenly did know why felt pang
day beautiful sun bright everything around gay slim pretty girl did know wish know existence contented cheerful own separate probably foolish bright happy life
glad about thinking military regulations arrangement ryaz serfs quitrents
thinking why happy prince andrew asked himself instinctive curiosity
1809 count ily rost living otr dnoe just done former years entertaining almost whole province hunts theatricals dinners music
glad see prince andrew see new visitor insisted staying night
during dull day course entertained elderly hosts more important visitors old count house crowded account approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced nat sha gay laughing among younger members company asked himself each time thinking about why glad night alone new surroundings long unable sleep
read awhile put out candle relit 
hot room inside shutters closed
cross stupid old man called rost made stay assuring necessary documents yet arrived from town vexed himself having stayed
got went window open 
soon opened shutters moonlight long been watching burst into room
night fresh bright very still
just before window row pollard trees looking black one side silvery light other
beneath trees grew kind lush wet bushy vegetation silver lit leaves stems there
farther back beyond dark trees roof glittered dew right leafy tree brilliantly white trunk branches above shone moon nearly full pale almost starless spring sky
prince andrew leaned elbows window ledge eyes rested sky
room first floor
heard female voices overhead
just oncemore said girlish voice above prince andrew recognized once
when are coming bed replied another voice
won can sleep use come now last time
two girlish voices sang musical passage end song
lovely now sleep there end 
sleep can said first voice coming nearer window
evidently leaning right out rustle dress even breathing could heard
everything stone still like moon light shadows
prince andrew dared stir fear betraying unintentional presence
nya nya again heard first speaker
can sleep only look glorious glorious wake nya said almost tears voice
there never never such lovely night before nya made reluctant reply
just come see moon 
darling sweetheart come there see feel like sitting down heels putting arms round knees like straining tight tight possible flying away like 
take care fall out
heard sound scuffle nya disapproving voice past one clock
only spoil things 
all right again all silent prince andrew knew still sitting there
from time time heard soft rustle times sigh
god god does mean suddenly exclaimed
bed must slammed casement
might well exist thought prince andrew listened voice reason expecting yet fearing might say something about 
there again purpose thought 
soul there suddenly arose such unexpected turmoil youthful thoughts hopes contrary whole tenor life unable explain condition himself lay down fell asleep once
next morning having taken leave one count waiting ladies appear prince andrew set off home
already beginning june when return journey drove into birch forest where gnarled old oak made strange memorable impression 
forest harness bells sounded yet more muffled than done six weeks before now all thick shady dense young firs dotted about forest did jar general beauty lending themselves mood around delicately green fluffy young shoots
whole day been hot
somewhere storm gathering only small cloud scattered raindrops lightly sprinkling road sappy leaves
left side forest dark shade right side glittered sunlight wet shiny scarcely swayed breeze
everything blossom nightingales trilled their voices reverberated now near now far away
yes forest oak agreed thought prince andrew
where again wondered gazing left side road without recognizing looked admiration very oak sought
old oak quite transfigured spreading out canopy sappy dark green foliage stood rapt slightly trembling rays evening sun
neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts sorrows evidence now
through hard century old bark even where there twigs leaves sprouted such one could hardly believe old veteran could produced
yes same oak thought prince andrew all once seized unreasoning springtime feeling joy renewal
all best moments life suddenly rose memory
austerlitz lofty heavens wife dead reproachful face pierre ferry girl thrilled beauty night night itself moon 
life over thirty one prince andrew suddenly decided finally decisively
enough know everyone must know pierre young girl wanted fly away into sky everyone must know life may lived myself alone others live apart from may reflected all may live harmony reaching home prince andrew decided petersburg autumn found all sorts reasons decision
whole series sensible logical considerations showing essential petersburg even enter service kept springing mind
could now understand could ever even doubted necessity taking active share life just month before understood idea leaving quiet country could ever enter head
now seemed clear all experience lifemust senselessly wasted unless applied kind work again played active part life
did even remember formerly strength similar wretched logical arguments seemed obvious would degrading himself now after lessons life allowed himself believe possibility being useful possibility happiness love
now reason suggested quite opposite
after journey ryaz found country dull former pursuits longer interested often when sitting alone study got went mirror gazed long time own face
would turn away portrait dead lise hair curled grecque looked tenderly gaily out gilt frame
did now say those former terrible words looked simply merrily inquisitively 
prince andrew crossing arms behind long paced room now frowning now smiling reflected those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret crime altered whole life connected pierre fame girl window oak woman beauty love
anyone came into room such moments particularly cold stern above all unpleasantly logical
dear princess mary entering such moment would say little nicholas can out today very cold
hot prince andrew would reply such times very dryly sister could out smock cold must wear warm clothes designed purpose
follows from fact cold child needs fresh air should remain home would add extreme logic punishing someone those secret illogical emotions stirred within 
such moments princess mary would think intellectual work dries men 
prince andrew arrived petersburg august 1809
time when youthful sper nski zenith fame reforms being pushed forward greatest energy
same august emperor thrown from cal che injured leg remained three weeks peterhof receiving sper nski every day one else
time two famous decrees being prepared agitated society abolishing court ranks introducing examinations qualify grades collegiate assessor state councilor merely whole state constitution intended change existing order government russia legal administrative financial from council state down district tribunals
now those vague liberal dreams emperor alexander ascended throne tried put into effect aid associates czartor ski novos ltsev kochub str gonov whom himself jest called comit salut public taking shape being realized
now all men replaced sper nski civil side arakch military
soon after arrival prince andrew gentleman chamber presented himself court levee
emperor though met twice did favor single word
always seemed prince andrew before antipathetic emperor latter disliked face personality generally cold repellent glance emperor gave now found further confirmation surmise
courtiers explained emperor neglect majesty displeasure bolk nski having served since 1805
know myself one cannot help one sympathies antipathies thought prince andrew will present proposal reform army regulations emperor personally project will speak itself
mentioned written old field marshal friend father 
field marshal made appointment see received graciously promised inform emperor
few days later prince andrew received notice see minister war count arakch 
appointed day prince andrew entered count arakch waiting room nine morning
did know arakch personally never seen all heard inspired little respect man
minister war man trusted emperor need concern myself about personal qualities been commissioned consider project alone can get adopted thought prince andrew waited among number important unimportant people count arakch waiting room
during service chiefly adjutant prince andrew seen anterooms many important men different types such rooms well known 
count arakch anteroom quite special character
faces unimportant people awaiting their turn audience showed embarrassment servility faces those higher rank expressed common feeling awkwardness covered mask unconcern ridicule themselves their situation person whom waiting
walked thoughtfully down others whispered laughed
prince andrew heard nickname andr evich words uncle will give hot reference count arakch 
one general important personage evidently feeling offended having wait long sat crossing uncrossing legs smiling contemptuously himself
moment door opened one feeling alone appeared all faces fear
prince andrew second time asked adjutant duty take name received ironical look told turn would come due course
after others been shown out minister room adjutant duty officer struck prince andrew humiliated frightened air admitted terrible door
suddenly grating sound harsh voice heard from other side door officer pale face trembling lips came out passed through waiting room clutching head
after prince andrew conducted door officer duty said whisper right window
prince andrew entered plain tidy room saw table man forty long waist long closely cropped head deep wrinkles scowling brows above dull greenish hazel eyes overhanging red nose
arakch turned head toward without looking

arakch eyes turned toward 
sit down said 
prince bolk nski petitioning about anything

endorsed resolution your memorandum sent committee

reforming party cordially welcomed courted first place reputed clever very well read secondly liberating serfs obtained reputation being liberal
party old dissatisfied censured innovations turned expecting sympathy their disapproval reforms simply son father
feminine society world welcomed gladly rich distinguished good match almost newcomer halo romance account supposed death tragic loss wife
besides general opinion all known previously greatly improved during last five yearshaving softened grown more manly lost former affectation pride contemptuous irony acquired serenity comes years
people talked about interested wanted meet

rose took prince andrew arm went meet tall bald fair man about forty large open forehead long face unusual peculiar whiteness just entering
newcomer wore blue swallow tail coat cross suspended from neck star left breast
prince andrew recognized once felt throb within happens critical moments life
whether from respect envy anticipation did know
sper nski whole figure peculiar type made easily recognizable
society prince andrew lived never seen anyone together awkward clumsy gestures possessed such calmness self assurance never seen resolute yet gentle expression those half closed rather humid eyes firm smile expressed nothing nor heard such refined smooth soft voice above all never seen such delicate whiteness face hands hands broad very plump soft white
such whiteness softness prince andrew only seen faces soldiers been long hospital
sper nski secretary state reporter emperor companion erfurt where more than once met talked napoleon
sper nski did shift eyes from one face another people involuntarily entering large company hurry speak
spoke slowly assurance would listened looked only person whom conversing
prince andrew followed sper nski every word movement particular attention
happens people especially men judge those near severely always meeting anyone new especially anyone whom like sper nski knew reputation expected discover perfection human qualities
sper nski told kochub sorry been unable come sooner been detained palace

when kochub introduced prince andrew sper nski slowly turned eyes bolk nski customary smile looked silence
very glad make your acquaintance
heard everyone said after pause
kochub said few words about reception arakch given bolk nski
chairman committee army regulations good friend monsieur magn tski said fully articulating every word syllable like can put touch 
paused full stop
hope will find sympathetic ready operate promoting all reasonable
circle soon formed round sper nski old man talked about subordinate pry nichnikov addressed question 
prince andrew without joining conversation watched every movement sper nski man long since insignificant divinity student now bolk nski thought held hands those plump white hands fate russia
prince andrew struck extraordinarily disdainful composure sper nski answered old man
appeared address condescending words from immeasurable height
when old man began speak loud sper nski smiled said could judge advantage disadvantage pleased sovereign
having talked little general circle sper nski rose coming prince andrew took along other end room
clear thought necessary interest himself bolk nski
chance talk prince during animated conversation venerable gentleman involved said mildly contemptuous smile intimating smile prince andrew understood insignificance people whom just been talking
known long time first from your action regard your serfs first example very desirable there should more imitators secondly are one those gentlemen chamber considered themselves offended new decree concerning ranks allotted courtiers causing much gossip tittle tattle
said prince andrew father did wish take advantage privilege
your father man last century evidently stands above our contemporaries condemn measure merely establishes natural justice
think however condemnations ground returned prince andrew trying resist sper nski influence began conscious
did like agree everything felt wish contradict
though usually spoke easily well felt difficulty expressing himself now talking sper nski
much absorbed observing famous man personality
grounds personal ambition maybe sper nski put quietly
state interest extent said prince andrew
mean asked sper nski quietly lowering eyes
admirer montesquieu replied prince andrew idea principe des monarchies est honneur para incontestable
certains droits privil ges noblesse paraissent tre des moyens soutenir sentiment
smile vanished from sper nski white face much improved change
vous envisagez question sous point vue began pronouncing french evident difficulty speaking even slower than russian quite calmly
sper nski went say honor honneur cannot upheld privileges harmful service honor honneur either negative concept doing blameworthy source emulation pursuit commendation rewards recognize 
arguments concise simple clear
institution upholding honor source emulation one similar gion honneur great emperor napoleon harmful helpful success service class court privilege
dispute cannot denied court privileges attained same end returned prince andrew
every courtier considers himself bound maintain position worthily
yet care avail yourself privilege prince said sper nski indicating smile wished finish amiably argument embarrassing companion
will honor calling wednesday added will after talking magn tski let know may interest shall also pleasure more detailed chat 
closing eyes bowed fran aise without taking leave trying attract little attention possible left room
during first weeks stay petersburg prince andrew felt whole trend thought formed during life seclusion quite overshadowed trifling cares engrossed city
returning home evening would jot down notebook four five necessary calls appointments certain hours
mechanism life arrangement day time everywhere absorbed greater part vital energy
did nothing did even think find time think only talked talked successfully thought country
sometimes noticed dissatisfaction repeated same remark same day different circles
busy whole days together time notice thinking nothing
done their first meeting kochub sper nski produced strong impression prince andrew wednesday when received own house talked long confidentially
bolk nski many people appeared contemptible insignificant creatures longed find someone living ideal perfection toward strove readily believed sper nski found ideal perfectly rational virtuous man
sper nski sprung from same class himself possessed same breeding traditions bolk nski would soon discovered weak human unheroic sides sper nski strange logical turn mind inspired respect all more did quite understand 
moreover sper nski either appreciated other capacity considered necessary win side showed off dispassionate calm reasonableness before prince andrew flattered subtle flattery goes hand hand self assurance consists tacit assumption one companion only man besides oneself capable understanding folly rest mankind reasonableness profundity one own ideas
during their long conversation wednesday evening sper nski more than once remarked regard everything above common level rooted custom
smile want wolves fed sheep safe
cannot understand 
all way seemed say understand areare
first long conversation sper nski only strengthened prince andrew feeling experienced toward their first meeting
saw remarkable clear thinking man vast intellect energy persistence attained power using solely welfare russia
prince andrew eyes sper nski man would himself wished one explained all facts life reasonably considered important only rational capable applying standard reason everything
everythingseemed simple clear sper nski exposition prince andrew involuntarily agreed about everything
replied argued only wished maintain independence submit sper nski opinions entirely
everything right everything should only one thing disconcerted prince andrew
sper nski cold mirrorlike look did allow one penetrate soul delicate white hands prince andrew involuntarily watched one does watch hands those possess power
mirrorlike gaze those delicate hands irritated prince andrew knew why
unpleasantly struck excessive contempt others observed sper nski diversity lines argument used support opinions
made use every kind mental device except analogy passed boldly seemed prince andrew from one another
now would take position practical man condemn dreamers now satirist laugh ironically opponents now grow severely logical suddenly rise realm metaphysics
last resource one very frequently employed
would transfer question metaphysical heights pass definitions space time thought having deduced refutation needed would again descend level original discussion
general trait sper nski mentality struck prince andrew most absolute unshakable belief power authority reason
evident thought could never occur prince andrewseemed natural namely after all impossible express all one thinks never felt doubt all think believe nonsense just peculiarity sper nski mind particularly attracted prince andrew
during first period their acquaintance bolk nski felt passionate admiration similar once felt bonaparte
fact sper nski son village priest stupid people might meanly despise account humble origin fact many did caused prince andrew cherish sentiment more unconsciously strengthen 
first evening bolk nski spent having mentioned commission revision code laws sper nski told sarcastically commission existed hundred fifty years cost millions done nothing except rosenkampf stuck labels corresponding paragraphs different codes
all state millions spent said 
want give senate new juridical powers laws
why sin men like prince serve times prince andrew said work education jurisprudence needed did possess
nobody possesses would vicious circle from must break way out
week later prince andrew member committee army regulations all expected chairman section committee revision laws

first put those did take active part affairs lodges human affairs exclusively occupied mystical science order questions threefold designation god three primordial elements sulphur mercury salt meaning square all various figures temple solomon
pierre respected class brothers elder ones chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alex evich himself did share their interests
heart mystical aspect freemasonry
second category pierre reckoned himself others like seeking vacillating yet found freemasonry straight comprehensible path hoped 
third category included those brothers majority saw nothing freemasonry external forms ceremonies prized strict performance forms without troubling about their purport significance
such willarski even grand master principal lodge
finally fourth category also great many brothers belonged particularly those lately joined
according pierre observations men belief anything nor desire anything joined freemasons merely associate wealthy young brothers influential through their connections rank whom there very many lodge
pierre began feel dissatisfied doing
freemasonry rate saw sometimes seemed based merely externals
did think doubting freemasonry itself suspected russian masonry taken wrong path deviated from original principles
toward end year went abroad initiated into higher secrets order
summer 1809 pierre returned petersburg
our freemasons knew from correspondence those abroad bez khov obtained confidence many highly placed persons been initiated into many mysteries been raised higher grade bringing back much might conduce advantage masonic cause russia
petersburg freemasons all came see tried ingratiate themselves seemed all preparing something concealing 
solemn meeting lodge second degree convened pierre promised communicate petersburg brothers deliver from highest leaders their order
meeting full one
after usual ceremonies pierre rose began address
dear brothers began blushing stammering written speech hand sufficient observe our mysteries seclusion our lodge must actactare drowsing must act
dissemination pure truth secure triumph virtue read must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse principles harmony spirit times undertake education young unite ourselves indissoluble bonds wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity folly form those devoted body linked together unity purpose possessed authority power
attain end must secure preponderance virtueover vice must endeavor secure honest man may even world receive lasting reward virtue
great endeavors are gravely hampered political institutions today
done circumstances favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force force 
every violent reform deserves censure quite fails remedy evil men remain are also wisdom needs violence
whole plan our order should based idea preparing men firmness virtue bound together unity conviction aiming punishment vice folly patronizing talent virtue raising worthy men from dust attaching our brotherhood
only will our order power unobtrusively bind hands protectors disorder control without their being aware 
word must found form government holding universal sway should diffused over whole world without destroying bonds citizenship beside all other governments can continue their customary course everything except impedes great aim our order obtain virtue victory over vice
aim christianity itself
taught menwise good their own benefit follow example instruction best wisest men
time when everything plunged darkness preaching alone course sufficient
novelty truth endowed special strength now need much more powerful methods
now necessary man governed sensesshould find virtue charm palpable those senses
impossible eradicate passions must strive direct noble aim therefore necessary everyone should able satisfy passions within limits virtue
soon certain number worthy men every state each again training two others all being closely united everything will possible our order already secret accomplished much welfare mankind
speech only made strong impression created excitement lodge
majority brothers seeing dangerous designs illuminism met coldness surprised pierre
grand master began answering pierre began developing views more more warmth
long since there been stormy meeting
parties formed accusing pierre illuminism others supporting 
meeting struck first time endless variety men minds prevents truth from ever presenting itself identically two persons
even those members seemed side understood their own way limitations alterations could agree always wanted most convey thought others just himself understood 
end meeting grand master irony ill will reproved bez khov vehemence said love virtue alone also love strife moved dispute
pierre did answer asked briefly whether proposal would accepted
told would without waiting usual formalities left lodge went home
again pierre overtaken depression dreaded
three days after delivery speech lodge lay sofa home receiving one going nowhere
just received letter from wife implored see telling grieved about wished devote whole life

same time mother law prince vas wife sent imploring come only few minutes discuss most important matter
pierre saw there conspiracy against wanted reunite wife mood even unpleasant 
nothing life seemed much importance under influence depression possessed valued neither liberty nor resolution punish wife
one right one blame blame thought

pierre just husband needed brilliant society woman
absent minded crank grand seigneur husband one way far from spoiling high tone general impression drawing room served contrast presented advantageous background elegant tactful wife
pierre during last two years result continual absorption abstract interests sincere contempt all else acquired wife circle did interest air unconcern indifference benevolence toward all cannot acquired artificially therefore inspires involuntary respect

now become bluestocking finally renounced former infatuations told himself
there never been instance bluestocking being carried away affairs heart statement though gathered from unknown source believed implicitly

opened book all pages there excellent drawings
dream knew drawings represented love adventures soul beloved
pages saw beautiful representation maiden transparent garments transparent body flying clouds
seemed know maiden nothing else than representation song songs
looking those drawings dreamed felt doing wrong could tear myself away from 
lord help god thy forsaking thy doing thy will done myself cause teach should shall perish debauchery thou utterly desertest rost monetary affairs improved during two years spent country
though nicholas rost kept firmly resolution still serving modestly obscure regiment spending comparatively little way life otr dnoe tenka management affairs particular such debts inevitably increased every year
only resource obviously presenting itself old count apply official post come petersburg look one also said let lassies enjoy themselves last time
soon after their arrival petersburg berg proposed accepted
though moscow rost belonged best society without themselves giving thought yet petersburg their circle acquaintances mixed indefinite one
petersburg provincials very people entertained moscow without inquiring set belonged looked down 
rost lived same hospitable way petersburg moscow most diverse people met their suppers

four years before meeting german comrade stalls moscow theater berg pointed out rost said german das soll mein weib werden from moment made mind marry 
now petersburg having considered rost position own decided time come propose
berg proposal first received perplexity flattering 
first seemed strange son obscure livonian gentleman should propose marriage countess rost berg chief characteristic such good natured egotism rost involuntarily came think would good thing since himself firmly convinced good indeed excellent
moreover rost affairs seriously embarrassed suitor could know above all twenty four been taken out everywhere though certainly good looking sensible one now proposed 
see said berg comrade whom called friend only knew everyone friends see considered all should marry thought all out way unsuitable
contrary papa mamma are now provided arranged rent baltic provinces can live petersburg pay fortune good management can get along nicely
marrying money consider dishonorable wife should bring share husband 
position service connections means
our times worth something isn above all handsome estimable girl loves 
berg blushed smiled
love character sensible very good

well will coming going say dine changed mind said take tea quickly doubling tongue blew small round ring tobacco smoke perfectly embodying dream happiness
after first feeling perplexity aroused parents berg proposal holiday tone joyousness usual such times took possession family rejoicing external insincere
family feeling toward wedding certain awkwardness constraint evident ashamed having loved sufficiently being ready get off their hands
old count felt most
would probably been unable state cause embarrassment resulted from state affairs

when daughters born assigned each dowry estate three hundred serfs one estates already been sold other mortgaged interest much arrears would sold impossible give 
berg already been engaged month only week remained before wedding count yet decided own mind question dowry nor spoken wife about 
one time count thought giving ryaz estate selling forest another time borrowing money note hand
few days before wedding berg entered count study early one morning pleasant smile respectfully asked future father law let know dowry would 
count disconcerted long foreseen inquiry without consideration gave first reply came into head
shall satisfied
patting berg shoulder got wishing end conversation
berg smiling pleasantly explained did know certain much would did receive least part dowry advance would break matters off
consider count allowed myself marry now without having definite means maintain wife should acting badly
conversation ended count wished generous avoid further importunity saying would give note hand eighty thousand rubles
berg smiled meekly kissed count shoulder said very grateful impossible arrange new life without receiving thirty thousand ready money
least twenty thousandcount added note hand only sixty thousand
yes yes all right said count hurriedly

can happen whatever trouble may come prince andrew continued beg mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen turn alone advice help most absent minded absurd fellow heart gold
neither father nor mother nor nya nor prince andrew himself could foreseen separation from lover would act nat sha
flushed agitated went about house all day dry eyed occupied most trivial matters understanding awaited 
did even cry when taking leave kissed hand last time
don said tone made wonder whether really ought stay remembered long afterwards
nor did cry when gone several days sat room dry eyed taking interest anything only saying now why did away fortnight after departure surprise those around recovered from mental sickness just suddenly became old self again change moral physiognomy child gets after long illness changed expression face
during year after son departure prince nicholas bolk nski health temper became much worse
grew still more irritable princess mary generally bore brunt frequent fits unprovoked anger
seemed carefully seek out tender spots torture mentally harshly possible
princess mary two passions consequently two joys nephew little nicholas religion favorite subjects prince attacks ridicule
whatever spoken would bring round superstitiousness old maids petting spoiling children
want make little nicholas into old maid like yourself pity prince andrew wants son old maid would say
turning mademoiselle bourienne would ask princess mary presence liked our village priests icons would joke about 
continually hurt princess mary feelings tormented cost effort forgive 
could blame toward could father whom knew loved spite all unjust justiceprincess never thought proud word justice
all complex laws man centered one clear simple law law love self sacrifice taught lovingly suffered mankind though himself god
justice injustice other people endure love did
during winter prince andrew come bald hills been gay gentle more affectionate than princess mary known long time past
felt something happened said nothing about love
before left long talk father about something princess mary noticed before departure dissatisfied one another
soon after prince andrew gone princess mary wrote friend julie kar gina petersburg whom dreamed all girls dream marrying brother time mourning own brother killed turkey
sorrow seems our common lot dear tender friend julie
your loss terrible can only explain myself special providence god loving wishes try your excellent mother
friend religion religion alone can will say comfort save from despair
religion alone can explain without help man cannot comprehend why cause kind noble beings able find happiness life merely harming one necessary happiness others are called away god cruel useless harmful persons such are burden themselves others are left living
first death saw one shall never forget dear sister law left impression 
just ask destiny why your splendid brother dieasked why angel lise only never wronged anyone whose soul there never unkind thoughts die
think dear friend five years passed since already petty understanding begin see clearly why die way death expression infinite goodness creator whose every action though generally incomprehensible manifestation infinite love creatures
perhaps often think angelically innocent strength perform all mother duties
young wife irreproachable perhaps could been mother
only left particularly prince andrew purest regrets memories probably will there receive place dare hope myself
speak alone early terrible death most beneficent influence brother spite all our grief
moment our loss thoughts could occur should dismissed horror now are very clear certain
write all dear friend only convince gospel truth become principle life single hair our heads willfall without will
will governed only infinite love whatever befalls our good
ask whether shall spend next winter moscow
spite wish see think want 
will surprised hear reason buonaparte case father health growing noticeably worse cannot stand contradiction becoming irritable
irritability know chiefly directed political questions
cannot endure notion buonaparte negotiating equal terms all sovereigns europe particularly our own grandson great catherine know quite indifferent politics from father remarks talks michael novich know all goes world especially about honors conferred buonaparte only bald hills whole world seems accepted great man still less emperor france
father cannot stand 
seems chiefly political views father reluctant speak going moscow foresees encounters would result from way expressing views regardless anybody
all benefit might derive from course treatment would lose result disputes about buonaparte would inevitable
our family life goes old way except brother andrew absence
wrote before changed very much late
after sorrow only year quite recovered spirits
again become used know when child kind affectionate heart gold know equal
realized seems life over 
together mental change grown physically much weaker
anxious about glad taking trip abroad doctors recommended long ago
write petersburg spoken one most active cultivated capable young men
forgive vanity relation never doubted 
good done everybody from peasants gentry incalculable
arrival petersburg received only due
always wonder way rumors fly from petersburg moscow especially such false ones write about mean report brother betrothal little rost 
think brother will ever marry again certainly why first know though rarely speaks about wife lost grief loss gone deep heart ever decide give successor our little angel stepmother
secondly far know girl kind girl could please prince andrew

running long end second sheet
may god keep holy mighty care
dear friend mademoiselle bourienne sends kisses
mary middle summer princess mary received unexpected letter from prince andrew switzerland gave strange surprising news

been always shall independent against will arouse anger now may perhaps remain such short time would destroy half happiness
now writing about same question beg choose good moment hand letter let know looks whole matter whether there hope may consent reduce term four months
after long hesitations doubts prayers princess mary gave letter father
next day old prince said quietly write tell your brother wait till dead
won long shall soon set free
princess about reply father would let speak raising voice more more cried marry marry boy 
clever people rich yes nice stepmother little nicholas will write tell may marry tomorrow likes
will little nicholas stepmother marry bourienne 
mustn without stepmother either only one thing more women are wanted house let marry live himself
perhaps will live added turning princess mary
heaven name out into frost
frost after outburst prince did speak more about matter
repressed vexation son poor spirited behavior found expression treatment daughter
former pretexts irony fresh one now added allusions stepmothers amiabilities mademoiselle bourienne
why shouldn marry asked daughter
make splendid princess latterly surprise bewilderment princess mary noticed father really associating more more frenchwoman
wrote prince andrew about reception letter comforted hopes reconciling their father idea
little nicholas education brother andrew religion princess mary joys consolations besides since everyone must personal hopes princess mary profoundest depths heart hidden dream hope supplied chief consolation life
comforting dream hope given god folk half witted other pilgrims visited without prince knowledge
longer lived more experience observation life greater wonder short sightedness men seek enjoyment happinessearth toiling suffering struggling harming one another obtain impossible visionary sinful happiness
prince andrew loved wife died enough wanted bind happiness another woman
father objected wanted more distinguished wealthier match andrew
all struggled suffered tormented one another injured their souls their eternal souls attainment benefits endure instant
only know ourselves christ son god came down earth told life moment probation yet cling think find happiness 
one realizes thought princess mary
one except despised god folk wallet back come back door afraid being seen prince fear ill usage fear causing sin
leave family home all cares worldly welfare order without clinging anything wander hempen rags from place place under assumed name doing one harm praying all those drive one away well those protect one higher than life truth there life truth there one pilgrim quiet pockmarked little woman fifty called theodosia over thirty years gone about barefoot worn heavy chains
once when room lamp dimly lit before icon theodosia talking life thought theodosia alone found true path life suddenly came princess mary such force resolved become pilgrim herself
when theodosia gone sleep princess mary thought about long time last made mind strange might seem must pilgrimage
disclosed thought one confessor father nfi monk approved intention
under guise present pilgrims princess mary prepared pilgrim complete costume herself coarse smock bast shoes rough coat black kerchief
often approaching chest drawers containing secret treasure princess mary paused uncertain whether time already come put project into execution
often listening pilgrims tales stimulated their simple speech mechanical full deep meaning several times point abandoning everything running away from home
imagination already pictured herself theodosia side dressed coarse rags walking staff wallet back along dusty road directing wanderings from one saint shrine another free from envy earthly love desire reaching last place where there more sorrow sighing eternal joy bliss
shall come place pray there before having time get used getting love shall farther
will till legs fail lie down die somewhere shall last reach eternal quiet haven where there neither sorrow nor sighing
thought princess mary
afterwards when saw father especially little koko nicholas resolve weakened
wept quietly felt sinner loved father little nephew more than god
bible legend tells absence labor idleness condition first man blessedness before fall
fallen man retained love idleness curse weighs race only seek our bread sweat our brows our moral nature such cannot both idle ease

man could find state felt though idle fulfilling duty would found one conditions man primitive blessedness
such state obligatory irreproachable idleness lot whole class military

wolf seemed say herself moved forward without again looking round quiet long easy yet resolute lope
ulyulyu cried nicholas voice own own accord good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies head off wolf borzois passed running faster still
nicholas did hear own cry nor feel galloping nor see borzois nor ground over went saw only wolf increasing speed bounded same direction along hollow
first come into view lka black markings powerful quarters gaining upon wolf
now ahead wolf turned head face instead putting speed usually did lka suddenly raised tail stiffened forelegs

god why nicholas cried despair
uncle huntsman galloping from other side across wolf path borzois once more stopped animal advance
again hemmed 
nicholas attendant uncle huntsman all riding round wolf crying ulyulyu shouting preparing dismount each moment wolf crouched back starting forward again every time shook herself moved toward wood where would safe

old count went home nat sha tya promised return very soon still early hunt went farther
midday put hounds into ravine thickly overgrown young trees
nicholas standing fallow field could see all whips
facing lay field winter rye there own huntsman stood alone hollow behind hazel bush
hounds scarcely been loosed before nicholas heard one knew volt giving tongueintervals other hounds joined now pausing now again giving tongue

there still improvement countess health impossible defer journey moscow longer
nat sha trousseau ordered house sold
moreover prince andrew expected moscow where old prince bolk nski spending winter nat sha felt sure already arrived
countess remained country count taking nya nat sha went moscow end january
after prince andrew engagement nat sha pierre without apparent cause suddenly felt impossible living before
firmly convinced truths revealed benefactor happy been perfecting inner man devoted himself such ardor all zest such life vanished after engagement andrew nat sha death joseph alex evich news reached almost same time
only skeleton life remained house brilliant wife now enjoyed favors very important personage acquaintance all petersburg court service dull formalities
life suddenly seemed pierre unexpectedly loathsome
ceased keeping diary avoided company brothers began going club again drank great deal came once more touch bachelor sets leading such life countess thought necessary speak severely about 
pierre felt right avoid compromising went away moscow
moscow soon entered huge house faded fading princesses still lived enormous retinue soon driving through town saw iberian shrine innumerable tapers burning before golden covers icons mlin square snow undisturbed vehicles sleigh drivers hovels vtsev vrazh those old moscovites desired nothing hurried nowhere ending their days leisurely when saw those old moscow ladies moscow balls english club felt himself home quiet haven
moscow felt peace home warm dirty old dressing gown
moscow society from old women down children received pierre like long expected guest whose place always ready awaiting 
moscow society pierre nicest kindest most intellectual merriest most magnanimous cranks heedless genial nobleman old russian type
purse always empty open everyone
benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons churches books one nothing met refusal from been two friends borrowed large sums from taken under their protection would given everything away
there never dinner soiree club without 
soon sank into place sofa after two bottles margaux surrounded talking disputing joking began
when there quarrels kindly smile well timed jests reconciled antagonists
masonic dinners dull dreary when there
when after bachelor supper rose amiable kindly smile yielding entreaties festive company drive off somewhere shouts delight triumph arose among young men
balls danced partner needed
young ladies married unmarried liked without making love equally amiable all especially after supper
est charmant pas sexe said 
pierre one those retired gentlemen waiting whom there hundreds good humoredly ending their days moscow
horrified would been seven years before when first arrived from abroad been told there need seek plan anything rut long been shaped eternally predetermined wriggle might would all position 
could believed one time longed all heart establish republic russia himself napoleon philosopher strategist conqueror napoleon seen possibility passionately desired regeneration sinful human race own progress highest degree perfection established schools hospitals liberated serfs instead all wealthy husband unfaithful wife retired gentleman waiting fond eating drinking unbuttoned waistcoat abusing government bit member moscow english club universal favorite moscow society
long time could reconcile himself idea one those same retired moscow gentlemen waiting despised seven years before
sometimes consoled himself thought only living life temporarily shocked thought many like himself entered life club temporarily all their teeth hair only left when single tooth hair remained
moments pride when thought position seemed quite different distinct from those other retired gentlemen waiting formerly despised empty stupid contented fellows satisfied their position still discontented want something mankind
perhaps all comrades mine struggled just like sought something new path life their own like brought force circumstances society race elemental force against man powerless condition said himselfmoments humility after living time moscow longer despised began grow fond respect pity comrades destiny pitied himself
pierre longer suffered moments despair hypochondria disgust life malady formerly found expression such acute attacks driven inwards never left moment
why going world would ask himself perplexity several times day involuntarily beginning reflect anew meaning phenomena life knowing experience there answers questions made haste turn away from took book hurried off club apoll nikol evich exchange gossip town
never cared anything own body one stupidest women world thought pierre regarded people acme intelligence refinement pay homage 
napoleon bonaparte despised all long great now become wretched comedian emperor francis wants offer daughter illegal marriage

thought pierre whole general deception everyone accepts accustomed astonished each time something new
understand deception confusion thought tell all see tried always found depths their souls understand only try see 
appears must become thought 
unfortunate capacity many men especially russians seeing believing possibility goodness truth seeing evil falsehood life clearly able take serious part 
every sphere work connected eyes evil deception
whatever tried whatever engaged evil falsehood repulsed blocked every path activity
yet live find occupation
dreadful under burden insoluble problems abandoned himself distraction order forget 
frequented every kind society drank much bought pictures engaged building above all read
read read everything came hand
coming home valets still taking off things picked book began read
from reading passed sleeping from sleeping gossip drawing rooms club from gossip carousals women from carousals back gossip reading wine
drinking became more more physical also moral necessity
though doctors warned corpulence wine dangerous drank great deal
only quite ease when having poured several glasses wine mechanically into large mouth felt pleasant warmth body amiability toward all fellows readiness respond superficially every idea without probing deeply
only after emptying bottle two did feel dimly terribly tangled skein life previously terrified dreadful thought
always conscious aspect skein buzzing head after dinner supper chatted listened conversation read
under influence wine said himself doesn matter
solution ready time now think all out later later never came
morning empty stomach all old questions appeared insoluble terrible ever pierre hastily picked book anyone came see glad
sometimes remembered heard soldiers war when entrenched under enemy fire nothing try hard find occupation more easily bear danger
pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life ambition cards framing laws women toys horses politics sport wine governmental affairs
nothing trivial nothing important all same only save oneself from best one can thought pierre
only see dreadful beginning winter prince nicholas bolk nski daughter moved moscow
time enthusiasm emperor alexander regime weakened patriotic anti french tendency prevailed there together past intellect originality once made prince nicholas bolk nski object particular respect moscovites center moscow opposition government
prince aged very much year
showed marked signs senility tendency fall asleep forgetfulness quite recent events remembrance remote ones childish vanity accepted role head moscow opposition
spite old man inspired all visitors alike feeling respectful veneration especially evening when came tea old fashioned coat powdered wig aroused anyone told abrupt stories past uttered yet more abrupt scathing criticisms present
all old fashioned house gigantic mirrors pre revolution furniture powdered footmen stern shrewd old man himself relic past century gentle daughter pretty frenchwoman reverently devoted presented majestic agreeable spectacle
visitors did reflect besides couple hours during saw their host there also twenty two hours day during private intimate life house continued
latterly private life become very trying princess mary
there moscow deprived greatest pleasures talks pilgrims solitude refreshed bald hills none advantages pleasures city life
did out into society everyone knew father would let anywhere without failing health prevented going out himself invited dinners evening parties
quite abandoned hope getting married
saw coldness malevolence old prince received dismissed young men possible suitors sometimes appeared their house
friends during visit moscow been disappointed two been nearest 
mademoiselle bourienne whom never been able quite frank now become unpleasant various reasons princess mary avoided 
julie whom corresponded last five years moscow proved quite alien when met
just julie death brothers become one richest heiresses moscow full whirl society pleasures
surrounded young men fancied suddenly learned appreciate worth
julie stage life society woman when feels last chance marrying come fate must decided now never
thursdays princess mary remembered mournful smile now one write since julie whose presence gave pleasure met every week
like old migr declined marry lady whom spent evenings years regretted julie presence having one write 
moscow princess mary one talk one whom confide sorrow much sorrow fell lot just 
time prince andrew return marriage approaching request prepare father been carried out fact seemed matters quite hopeless every mention young countess rost old prince apart from usually bad temper lost control himself
another lately added sorrow arose from lessons gave six year old nephew
consternation detected herself relation little nicholas symptoms father irritability
however often told herself must get irritable when teaching nephew almost every time pointer hand sat down show french alphabet longed pour own knowledge quickly easily into child already afraid auntie might moment get angry slightest inattention trembled became flustered heated raised voice sometimes pulled arm put corner
having put corner would herself begin cry over cruel evil nature little nicholas following example would sob without permission would leave corner come pull wet hands from face comfort 
distressed princess most all father irritability always directed against late amounted cruelty
forced prostrate herself ground all night beaten made fetch wood water would never entered mind think position hard loving despot more cruel loved reason tormented himself knew merely hurt humiliate deliberately show always blame everything
late exhibited new trait tormented princess mary more than anything else ever increasing intimacy mademoiselle bourienne
idea first moment receiving news son intentions occurred jest andrew got married himself would marry bourienneevidently pleased latterly persistently seemed princess mary merely offend shown special endearments companion expressed dissatisfaction daughter demonstrations love bourienne
one day moscow princess mary presence thought father did purposely when there old prince kissed mademoiselle bourienne hand drawing embraced affectionately
princess mary flushed ran out room
few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess mary room smiling making cheerful remarks agreeable voice
princess mary hastily wiped away tears went resolutely mademoiselle bourienne evidently unconscious doing began shouting angry haste frenchwoman voice breaking horrible vile inhuman take advantage weakness
leave room exclaimed burst into sobs
next day prince did say word daughter noticed dinner gave orders mademoiselle bourienne should served first
after dinner when footman handed coffee from habit began princess prince suddenly grew furious threw stick philip instantly gave instructions conscripted army

doesn obey first person house best friend cried prince
allow yourself screamed fury addressing princess mary first time forget yourself again before dared yesterday will show master house
don let set eyes beg pardon princess mary asked mademoiselle bourienne pardon also father pardon herself philip footman begged intervention
such moments something like pride sacrifice gathered soul
suddenly father whom judged would look spectacles presence fumbling near seeing would forget something just occurred take false step failing legs turn see anyone noticed feebleness worst all dinner when there visitors excite would suddenly fall asleep letting napkin drop shaking head sink over plate
old feeble dare condemn thought such moments feeling revulsion against herself

french noncommissioned officer hussars crimson uniform shaggy cap shouted approaching balash halt
balash did once continued advance along road walking pace
noncommissioned officer frowned muttering words abuse advanced horse chest against balash put hand saber shouted rudely russian general asking deaf did told balash mentioned 
noncommissioned officer began talking comrades about regimental matters without looking russian general
after living seat highest authority power after conversing emperor less than three hours before general being accustomed respect due rank service balash found very strange russian soil encounter hostile still more disrespectful application brute force himself
sun only just appearing from behind clouds air fresh dewy
herd cattle being driven along road from village over fields larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising water
balash looked around awaiting arrival officer from village
russian cossacks bugler french hussars looked silently one another from timetime
french colonel hussarsevidently just left bed came riding from village handsome sleek gray horse accompanied two hussars
officer soldiers their horses all looked smart well kept

man rode toward balash gallop plumes flowing gems gold lace glittering bright june sunshine
balash only two horses length from equestrian bracelets plumes necklaces gold embroidery galloping toward theatrically solemn countenance when julner french colonel whispered respectfully king naplesfact murat now called king naples
though quite incomprehensible why should king naples called himself convinced therefore assumed more solemn important air than formerly
sure really king naples when eve departure from city walking through streets wife italians called out viva turned wife pensive smile said poor fellows don know leaving tomorrow though firmly believed himself king naples pitied grief felt subjects abandoning latterly after been ordered return military service especially since last interview napoleon danzig when august brother law told made king should reign way yours cheerfully taken familiar business like well fed overfat horse feels himself harness grows skittish between shafts dressed clothes variegated expensive possible gaily contentedly galloped along roads poland without himself knowing why whither
seeing russian general threw back head long hair curling shoulders majestically royal manner looked inquiringly french colonel
colonel respectfully informed majesty balash mission whose name could pronounce
bal mach said king overcoming assurance difficulty presented itself colonel 
charmed make your acquaintance general added gesture kingly condescension

said balash using words your majesty every opportunity affectation unavoidable frequently addressing one whom title still novelty
murat face beamed stupid satisfaction listened monsieur bal mach 
royaut oblige felt incumbent king ally confer state affairs alexander envoy
dismounted took balash arm moving few steps away from suite waited respectfully began pace down trying speak significantly
referred fact emperor napoleon resented demand should withdraw troops from prussia especially when demand became generally known dignity france thereby offended
balash replied there nothing offensive demand

balash rode supposing from murat words would very soon brought before napoleon himself
instead next village sentinels davoutinfantry corps detained pickets vanguard done adjutant corps commander fetched conducted into village marshal davout
davout napoleon arakch alexander though coward like arakch precise cruel unable express devotion monarch except cruelty
organism states such men are necessary wolves are necessary organism nature always exist always appear hold their own however incongruous their presence their proximity head government may 
inevitability alone can explain cruel arakch tore out grenadier mustache own hands whose weak nerves rendered unable face danger neither educated man nor courtier able maintain powerful position alexander whose own character chivalrous noble gentle
balash found davout seated barrel shed peasant hut writing auditing accounts
better quarters could been found marshal davout one those men purposely put themselves most depressing conditions justification being gloomy
same reason are always hard work hurry
can think bright side life when see sitting barrel working dirty shed expression face seemed say
chief pleasure necessity such men when encounter anyone shows animation flaunt their own dreary persistent activity
davout allowed himself pleasure when balash brought 
became still more absorbed task when russian general entered after glancing over spectacles balash face animated beauty morning talk murat did rise even stir scowled still more sneered malevolently
when noticed balash face disagreeable impression reception produced davout raised head coldly asked wanted
thinking could been received such manner only davout did know adjutant general emperor alexander even envoy napoleon balash hastened inform rank mission
contrary expectation davout after hearing became still surlier ruder
where your dispatch inquired

minute later marshal adjutant castr came conducted balash quarters assigned 
day dined marshal same board barrels
next day davout rode out early after asking balash come peremptorily requested remain there move baggage train should orders come move talk one except monsieur castr 
after four days solitude ennui consciousness impotence insignificance particularly acute contrast sphere power lately moved after several marches marshal baggage french army occupied whole district balash brought lna now occupied french through very gate left four days previously
next day imperial gentleman waiting comte turenne came balash informed emperor napoleon wish honor audience
four days before sentinels preobrazh nsk regiment stood front house balash conducted now two french grenadiers stood there blue uniforms unfastened front shaggy caps their heads escort hussars uhlans brilliant suite aides camp pages generals waiting napoleon come out standing porch round saddle horse mameluke rustan
napoleon received balash very house lna from alexander dispatched mission
though balash used imperial pomp amazed luxury magnificence napoleon court
comte turenne showed into big reception room where many generals gentlemen waitingpolish magnates several whom balash seen court emperor russia waiting
duroc said napoleon would receive russian general before going ride
after minutes gentleman waiting duty came into great reception room bowing politely asked balash follow 
balash went into small reception room one door led into study very one from russian emperor dispatched mission
heard hurried footsteps beyond door both halves opened rapidly all silent from study sound heard other steps firm resolute those napoleon
just finished dressing ride wore blue uniform opening front over white waistcoat long covered rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting fat thighs short legs hessian boots
short hair evidently just been brushed one lock hung down middle broad forehead
plump white neck stood out sharply above black collar uniform smelled eau cologne

whole short corpulent figure broad thick shoulders chest stomach involuntarily protruding imposing stately appearance one sees men forty live comfort
evident best spirits day
nodded answer balash low respectful bow coming once began speaking like man values every moment time does condescend prepare say sure will always say right thing say well
good day general said 
received letter brought from emperor alexander very glad see 
glanced large eyes into balash face immediately looked past 
plain balash personality did interest all
evidently only took place within own mind interested 
nothing outside himself significance everything world seemed depended entirely will
did desire war continued been forced 
even now emphasized word ready receive explanations can give 
began clearly concisely explain reasons dissatisfaction russian government
judging calmly moderate amicable tone french emperor spoke balash firmly persuaded wished peace intended enter into negotiations
when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly russian envoy balash began speech prepared long before sire emperor master
sight emperor eyes bent confused 
are flurried compose yourself napoleon seemed say scarcely perceptible smile looked balash uniform sword
balash recovered himself began speak
said emperor alexander did consider kur kin demand passports sufficient cause war kur kin acted own initiative without sovereign assent emperor alexander did desire war relations england
yet interposed napoleon fearing give vent feelings frowned nodded slightly sign balash might proceed
after saying all been instructed say balash added emperor alexander wished peace would enter into negotiations except condition 
balash hesitated remembered words emperor alexander written letter specially inserted rescript saltyk told balash repeat napoleon
balash remembered words long single armed foe remains russian soil complex feeling restrained 
could utter though wished 
grew confused said condition french army retires beyond niemen
napoleon noticed balash embarrassment when uttering last words face twitched calf left leg began quiver rhythmically
without moving from where stood began speaking louder tone more hurriedly than before
during speech followed balash more than once lowered eyes involuntarily noticed quivering napoleon left leg increased more napoleon raised voice
desire peace less than emperor alexander began
eighteen months been doing everything obtain waited eighteen months explanations
order begin negotiations demanded said frowning making energetic gesture inquiry small white plump hand
withdrawal your army beyond niemen sire replied balash 
niemen repeated napoleon
now want retire beyond niemen only niemen repeated napoleon looking straight balash 
latter bowed head respectfully
instead demand four months earlier withdraw from pomerania only withdrawal beyond niemen now demanded
napoleon turned quickly began pace room
say demand now withdraw beyond niemen before commencing negotiations just same way two months ago demand should withdraw beyond vistula oder yet are willing negotiate
went silence from one corner room other again stopped front balash 
balash noticed left leg quivering faster than before face seemed petrified stern expression
quivering left leg thing napoleon conscious 
vibration left calf great sign remarked later date
such demands retreat beyond vistula oder may made prince baden napoleon almost screamed quite own surprise
gave petersburg moscow could accept such conditions
say begun war first joined army emperor alexander offer negotiations when expended millions when are alliance england when your position bad one
offer negotiations aim your alliance england given continued hurriedly evidently longer trying show advantages peace discuss possibility only prove own rectitude power alexander errors duplicity
commencement speech obviously been made intention demonstrating advantages position showing nevertheless willing negotiate
begun talking more talked less could control words
whole purport remarks now evidently exalt himself insult alexander just least desired commencement interview
hear made peace turkey balash bowed head affirmatively
peace been concluded
napoleon did let speak
evidently wanted all talking himself continued talk sort eloquence unrestrained irritability spoiled people are prone
yes know made peace turks without obtaining moldavia wallachia would given your sovereign those provinces gave finland
yes went promised would given emperor alexander moldavia wallachia now won those splendid provinces
yet might united empire single reign would extended russia from gulf bothnia mouths danube
catherine great could done more said napoleon growing more more excited paced down room repeating balash almost very words used alexander himself tilsit
all would owed friendship
splendid reign repeated several times paused drew from pocket gold snuffbox lifted nose greedily sniffed 
splendid reign emperor alexander might been looked compassionately balash soon latter tried make rejoinder hastily interrupted 
could wish look would obtained through friendship demanded napoleon shrugging shoulders perplexity
preferred surround himself enemies whom steins armfeldts bennigsens wintzingerodes stein traitor expelled from own country armfeldt rake intriguer wintzingerode fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more soldier than others all same incompetent unable anything 1807 should awaken terrible memories emperor alexander mind
granted competent might made use continued napoleon hardly able keep pace words rush thoughts incessantly sprang proving right strong perception two one same are even are neither fit war nor peace barclay said most capable all cannot say judging first movements
are doing all courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers barclay called act does know decide time passes bringing result
stupid experience quick eye resolution
role your young monarch playing monstrous crowd compromise throw responsibility all happens
sovereign should army unless general said napoleon evidently uttering words direct challenge emperor
knew alexander desired military commander
campaign began only week ago haven even been able defend lna
are cut two been driven out polish provinces
contrary your majesty said balash hardly able remember been said following verbal fireworks difficulty troops are burning eagerness
know everything napoleon interrupted 
know number your battalions exactly know own
two hundred thousand men three times number
give word honor said napoleon forgetting word honor could carry weight give word honor five hundred thirty thousand men side vistula
turks will use are worth nothing shown making peace 
swedes their fate governed mad kings
their king insane changed another bernadotte promptly went madswede would ally himself russia unless mad
napoleon grinned maliciously again raised snuffbox nose
balash knew reply each napoleon remarks would done continually made gesture man wishing say something napoleon always interrupted

every detail interview communicated russian monarch war began
after interview pierre moscow prince andrew went petersburg business told family really meet anatole kur gin whom felt necessary encounter
reaching petersburg inquired kur gin latter already left city
pierre warned brother law prince andrew track
anatole kur gin promptly obtained appointment from minister war went join army moldavia
petersburg prince andrew met kut zov former commander always well disposed toward kut zov suggested should accompany army moldavia old general been appointed commander chief
prince andrew having received appointment headquarters staff left turkey
prince andrew did think proper write challenge kur gin
thought challenged without fresh cause might compromise young countess rost wanted meet kur gin personally order find fresh pretext duel
again failed meet kur gin turkey soon after prince andrew arrived latter returned russia
new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier bear
after betrothed broken faith felt more acutely more tried conceal effects surroundings been happy became trying freedom independence once prized highly still more 
only could longer think thoughts first come lay gazing sky field austerlitz later enlarged upon pierre filled solitude boguch rovo switzerland rome even dreaded recall bright boundless horizons revealed
now concerned only nearest practical matters unrelated past interests seized more eagerly more those past interests closed 
lofty infinite canopy heaven once towered above suddenly turned into low solid vault weighed down all clear nothing eternal mysterious
activities presented themselves army service simplest most familiar
general duty kut zov staff applied himself business zeal perseverance surprised kut zov willingness accuracy work
having found kur gin turkey prince andrew did think necessary rush back russia after all same knew however long might before met kur gin despite contempt despite all proofs deduced convince himself worth stooping conflict knew when did meet would able resist calling out more than ravenous man can help snatching food
consciousness insult yet avenged rancor still unspent weighed heart poisoned artificial tranquillity managed obtain turkey means restless plodding rather vainglorious ambitious activity
year 1812 when news war napoleon reached bucharest where kut zov been living two months passing days nights wallachian woman prince andrew asked kut zov transfer western army
kut zov already weary bolk nski activity seemed reproach own idleness very readily let gave mission barclay tolly
before joining western army may encamped drissa prince andrew visited bald hills directly way being only two miles off smol nsk highroad
during last three years there been many changes life thought felt seen much having traveled both east west reaching bald hills struck strange unexpected find way life there unchanged still same every detail
entered through gates their stone pillars drove avenue leading house entering enchanted sleeping castle
same old stateliness same cleanliness same stillness reigned there inside there same furniture same walls sounds smell same timid faces only somewhat older
princess mary still same timid plain maiden getting years uselessly joylessly passing best years life fear constant suffering
mademoiselle bourienne same coquettish self satisfied girl enjoying every moment existence full joyous hopes future
merely become more self confident prince andrew thought
dessalles tutor brought from switzerland wearing coat russian cut talking broken russian servants still same narrowly intelligent conscientious pedantic preceptor
old prince changed appearance only loss tooth left noticeable gap one side mouth character same ever only showing still more irritability skepticism happening world
little nicholas alone changed
grown become rosier curly dark hair when merry laughing quite unconsciously lifted upper lip pretty little mouth just little princess used 
alone did obey law immutability enchanted sleeping castle
though externally all remained old inner relations all people changed since prince andrew seen last
household divided into two alien hostile camps changed their habits sake only met there
one camp belonged old prince mademoiselle bourienne architect other princess mary dessalles little nicholas all old nurses maids
during stay bald hills all family dined together ill ease prince andrew felt visitor whose sake exception being made presence made all feel awkward
involuntarily feeling dinnerfirst day taciturn old prince noticing also became morosely dumb retired apartments directly after dinner
evening when prince andrew went trying rouse began tell young count mensky campaign old prince began unexpectedly talk about princess mary blaming superstitions dislike mademoiselle bourienne said only person really attached 
old prince said ill only princess mary purposely worried irritated indulgence silly talk spoiling little prince nicholas
old prince knew very well tormented daughter life very hard also knew could help tormenting deserved 
why does princeandrew sees say nothing about sister does think scoundrel old fool without reason keeps own daughter distance attaches frenchwoman himself doesn understand must explain must hear out thought old prince
began explaining why could put daughter unreasonable character
ask said prince andrew without looking censuring father first time life did wish speak about ask will give frank opinion
there misunderstanding discord between mary can blame all
since ask continued prince andrew becoming irritable always liable late can only say there are misunderstandings are caused worthless woman fit sister companion
old man first stared fixedly son unnatural smile disclosed fresh gap between teeth prince andrew could get accustomed
companion dear boy already been talking over father did want judge said prince andrew hard bitter tone challenged said always shall say mary blame those blame one blame frenchwoman
passed judgment
passed judgement said old man low voice seemed prince andrew embarrassment suddenly jumped cried off off let trace remain 
prince andrew wished leave once princess mary persuaded stay another day
day did see father did leave room admitted one mademoiselle bourienne khon asked several times whether son gone
next day before leaving prince andrew went son rooms
boy curly headed like mother glowing health sat knee prince andrew began telling storybluebeard fell into reverie without finishing story
thought pretty child son whom held knee himself
sought himself either remorse having angered father regret leaving home first time life bad terms horrified find neither
meant still more sought did find himself former tenderness son hoped reawaken caressing boy taking knee
well said son
prince andrew without replying put down from knee went out room
soon prince andrew given daily occupations especially returning old conditions life amid been happy weariness life overcame former intensity hastened escape from memories find work soon possible
decided andrew asked sister
thank god can replied prince andrew
very sorry can 
why say replied princess mary
why say when are going terrible war old mademoiselle bourienne says been asking about 
soon began speak lips trembled tears began fall
god god when one thinks trash can cause people misery said malignity alarmed princess mary
understood when speaking trash referred only mademoiselle bourienne cause misery also man ruined own happiness
andrew one thing beg entreat said touching elbow looking eyes shone through tears
understand looked down 
don imagine sorrow work men
men are tools
looked little above prince andrew head confident accustomed look one looks place where familiar portrait hangs
sorrow sent men
men are instruments are blame
think someone wronged forget forgive right punish
will know happiness forgiving
woman would mary
man should cannot forgive forget replied though till moment been thinking kur gin all unexpended anger suddenly swelled heart
mary already persuading forgive means ought long ago punished thought
giving further reply began thinking glad vindictive moment when would meet kur gin knew now army
princess mary begged stay one day more saying knew unhappy father would andrew left without being reconciled prince andrew replied would probably soon back again from army would certainly write father longer stayed now more embittered their differences would become
good andrew remember misfortunes come from god men are never blame last words heard from sister when took leave 
must thought prince andrew drove out avenue from house bald hills
poor innocent creature left victimized old man outlived wits
old man feels guilty cannot change himself
boy growing rejoices life like everybody else will deceive deceived
off army
want meet man whom despise give chance kill laugh conditions life been same before all connected now all tumbled pieces
only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another prince andrew mind
prince andrew reached general headquarters army end june
first army emperor occupied fortified camp drissa second army retreating trying effect junction first one from said cut off large french forces
everyone dissatisfied general course affairs russian army one anticipated danger invasion russian provincesone thought war would extend farther than western polish provinces
prince andrew found barclay tolly whom been assigned bank drissa
there single town large village vicinity camp immense number generals courtiers accompanying army living best houses villages both sides river over radius six miles
barclay tolly quartered nearly three miles from emperor
received bolk nski stiffly coldly told foreign accent would mention emperor decision employment asked meanwhile remain staff
anatole kur gin whom prince andrew hoped find army there
gone petersburg prince andrew glad hear 
mind occupied interests center conducting gigantic war glad free from distraction caused thought kur gin
during first four days duties required prince andrew rode round whole fortified camp aid own knowledge talks experts tried form definite opinion about 
question whether camp advantageous disadvantageous remained undecided
already from military experience seen austrian campaign come conclusion war most deeply considered plans significance all depends way unexpected movements enemy cannot foreseen are met whom whole matter handled
clear last point himself prince andrew utilizing position acquaintances tried fathom character control army men parties engaged deduced himself following state affairs
emperor still been lna forces been divided into three armies
first army under barclay tolly secondly army under bagrati thirdly one commanded torm sov
emperor first army commander chief
orders issued stated emperor would take command only would army
emperor moreover commander chief staffimperial headquarters staff
attendance head imperial staffquartermaster general prince volk nski well generals imperial aides camp diplomatic officials large number foreigners army staff
besides there attendance emperor without definite appointments arakch minister war count bennigsen senior general rank grand duke tsar vich constantine vlovich count rumy ntsev chancellor stein former prussian minister armfeldt swedish general pfuel chief author plan campaign paulucci adjutant general sardinian migr wolzogen many others
though men military appointment army their position gave influence often corps commander even commander chief did know capacity questioned bennigsen grand duke arakch prince volk nski given advice did know whether certain order received form advice emanated from man gave from emperor whether executed 
only external condition essential significance presence emperor all people from courtier point view emperor vicinity all became courtiers clear everyone
emperor did assume title commander chief disposed all armies men around assistants
arakch faithful custodian enforce order acted sovereign bodyguard
bennigsen landlord lna province appeared doing honors district reality good general useful adviser ready hand replace barclay
grand duke there suited 
minister stein there advice useful emperor alexander held high esteem personally
armfeldt virulently hated napoleon general full self confidence quality always influenced alexander
paulucci there bold decided speech
adjutants general there always accompanied emperor lastly chiefly pfuel there drawn plan campaign against napoleon having induced alexander believe efficacy plan directing whole business war
pfuel wolzogen expressed pfuel thoughts more comprehensible way than pfuel himself harsh bookish theorist self confident point despising everyone else able 
besides russians foreigners propounded new unexpected ideas every day especially foreigners did boldness characteristic people employed country their own theremany secondary personages accompanying army their principals there
among opinions voices immense restless brilliant proud sphere prince andrew noticed following sharply defined subdivisions tendencies parties first party consisted pfuel adherents military theorists believed science war immutable laws laws oblique movements outflankings forth
pfuel adherents demanded retirement into depths country accordance precise laws defined pseudo theorywar saw only barbarism ignorance evil intention every deviation from theory
party belonged foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode others chiefly germans
second party directly opposed first one extreme always happens met representatives other
members party those demanded advance from lna into poland freedom from all prearranged plans
besides being advocates bold action section also represented nationalism made still more one sided dispute
russians bagrati erm lov beginning come front others
time famous joke erm lov being circulated great favor petitioned emperor make german
men party remembering suv rov said one reason stick pins into maps fight beat enemy keep out russia let army get discouraged
third party emperor most confidence belonged courtiers tried arrange compromises between other two
members party chiefly civilians whom arakch belonged thought said men convictions wish seem generally say
said undoubtedly war particularly against such genius bonaparte called bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans profound scientific knowledge respect pfuel genius same time acknowledged theorists are often one sided therefore one should trust absolutely should also listen pfuel opponents practical men experience warfare say choose middle course
insisted retention camp drissa according pfuel plan changing movements other armies
though course neither one aim nor other could attained yet seemed best adherents third party
fourth opinion most conspicuous representative tsar vich could forget disillusionment austerlitz where ridden out head guards casque cavalry uniform review expecting crush french gallantly unexpectedly finding himself front line narrowly escaped amid general confusion
men party both quality defect frankness their opinions
feared napoleon recognized strength their own weakness frankly said 
said nothing sorrow shame ruin will come all abandoned lna tebsk shall abandon drissa
only reasonable thing left conclude peace soon possible before are turned out petersburg
view very general upper army circles found support also petersburg from chancellor rumy ntsev other reasons state favor peace
fifth party consisted those adherents barclay tolly much man minister war commander chief
may always began like honest practical man nobody better
give real power war cannot conducted successfully without unity command will show can did finland
our army well organized strong withdrawn drissa without suffering defeats owe entirely barclay
barclay now superseded bennigsen all will lost bennigsen showed incapacity already 1807
sixth party bennigsenites said contrary rate there one more active experienced than bennigsen twist about may will come bennigsen eventually
let others make mistakes now said arguing our retirement drissa most shameful reverse unbroken series blunders
more mistakes are made better
will rate understood all sooner things cannot like 
wanted barclay other manlike bennigsen made mark 1807 whom napoleon himself did justice manwhose authority would willingly recognized bennigsen only such man
seventh party consisted sort people are always found especially around young sovereigns whom there particularly many round alexander generals imperial aides camp passionately devoted emperor merely monarch man adoring sincerely disinterestedly rost done 1805 saw only all virtues all human capabilities well
men though enchanted sovereign refusing command army yet blamed such excessive modesty only desired insisted their adored sovereign should abandon diffidence openly announce would place himself head army gather round commander chief staff consulting experienced theoreticians practical men where necessary would himself lead troops whose spirits would thereby raised highest pitch
eighth largest group enormous numbers others ninety nine one consisted men desired neither peace nor war neither advance nor defensive camp drissa anywhere else neither barclay nor emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen only one most essential thing much advantage pleasure themselves possible
troubled waters conflicting intersecting intrigues eddied about emperor headquarters possible succeed many ways unthinkable other times
man simply wished retain lucrative post would today agree pfuel tomorrow opponent day after merely avoid responsibility please emperor would declare opinion all matter
another wished gain advantage would attract emperor attention loudly advocating very thing emperor hinted day before would dispute shout council beating breast challenging those did agree duels thereby proving prepared sacrifice himself common good
third absence opponents between two councils would simply solicit special gratuity faithful services well knowing moment people would busy refuse 
fourth seemingly overwhelmed work would often come accidentally under emperor eye
fifth achieve long cherished aim dining emperor would stubbornly insist correctness falsity newly emerging opinion object would produce arguments more less forcible correct
all men party fishing rubles decorations promotions pursuit watched only weathercock imperial favor directly noticed turning direction whole drone population army began blowing hard way all harder emperor turn elsewhere
amid uncertainties position menace serious danger giving peculiarly threatening character everything amid vortex intrigue egotism conflict views feelings diversity race among people eighth largest party those preoccupied personal interests imparted great confusion obscurity common task
whatever question arose swarm drones without having finished their buzzing previous theme flew over new one their hum drowned obscured voices those disputing honestly
from among all parties just time prince andrew reached army another ninth party being formed beginning raise voice
party elders reasonable men experienced capable state affairs without sharing those conflicting opinions able take detached view going staff headquarters consider means escape from muddle indecision intricacy weakness
men party said thought wrong resulted chiefly from emperor presence army military court from consequent presence there indefinite conditional unsteady fluctuation relations place court harmful army sovereign should reign command army only way out position would emperor court leave army mere presence emperor paralyzed action fifty thousand men required secure personal safety worst commander chief independent would better than very best one trammeled presence authority monarch
just time prince andrew living unoccupied drissa shishk secretary state one chief representatives party wrote letter emperor arakch balash agreed sign
letter availing himself permission given emperor discuss general course affairs respectfully suggested plea necessary sovereign arouse warlike spirit people capital emperor should leave army
arousing people their sovereign call defend their country very incitement chief cause russia triumph far produced tsar personal presence moscow suggested emperor accepted pretext quitting army
letter yet been presented emperor when barclay one day dinner informed bolk nski sovereign wished see personally question about turkey prince andrew present himself bennigsen quarters six evening
news received emperor quarters very day fresh movement napoleon might endanger army news subsequently found false
morning colonel michaud ridden round drissa fortifications emperor pointed out fortified camp constructed pfuel till considered chef oeuvre tactical science would ensure napoleon destruction absurdity threatening destruction russian army
prince andrew arrived bennigsen quarters country gentleman house moderate size situated very banks river
neither bennigsen nor emperor there chern shev emperor aide camp received bolk nski informed emperor accompanied general bennigsen marquis paulucci gone second time day inspect fortifications drissa camp suitability serious doubts beginning felt
chern shev sitting window first room french novel hand
room probably been music room there still organ rugs piled one corner stood folding bedstead bennigsen adjutant
adjutant also there sat dozing rolled bedding evidently exhausted work feasting
two doors led from room one straight into been drawing room another right study
through first door came sound voices conversing german occasionally french
drawing room gathered emperor wish military council emperor preferred indefiniteness certain persons whose opinions wished know view impending difficulties
council war council elucidate certain questions emperor personally
semicouncil been invited swedish general armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon referred renegade french subject michaud toll count stein military man all pfuel himself prince andrew heard mainspring whole affair
prince andrew opportunity getting good look pfuel arrived soon after himself passing through drawing room stopped minute speak chern shev
first sight pfuel ill made uniform russian general fitted badly like fancy costume seemed familiar prince andrew though saw now first time
there about something weyrother mack schmidt many other german theorist generals whom prince andrew seen 1805 more typical than 
prince andrew never yet seen german theorist whom all characteristics those others united such extent
pfuel short very thin broad boned coarse robust build broad hips prominent shoulder blades
face much wrinkled eyes deep set
hair evidently been hastily brushed smooth front temples stuck behind quaint little tufts
entered room looking restlessly angrily around afraid everything large apartment
awkwardly holding sword addressed chern shev asked german where emperor 
one could see wished pass through rooms quickly possible finish bows greetings sit down business front map where would feel home
nodded hurriedly reply chern shev smiled ironically hearing sovereign inspecting fortifications pfuel planned accord theory
muttered something himself abruptly bass voice self assured germans might been stupid fellow 
whole affair will ruined something absurd will come 
prince andrew did catch said would passed chern shev introduced pfuel remarking prince andrew just back from turkey where war terminated fortunately
pfuel barely glanced much prince andrew past said laugh must been fine tactical war laughing contemptuously went into room from sound voices heard
pfuel always inclined irritably sarcastic particularly disturbed day evidently fact dared inspect criticize camp absence
from short interview pfuel prince andrew thanks austerlitz experiences able form clear conception man
pfuel one those hopelessly immutably self confident men self confident point martyrdom only germans are only germans are self confident basis abstract notion science supposed knowledge absolute truth
frenchman self assured regards himself personally both mind body irresistibly attractive men women
englishman self assured being citizen best organized state world therefore englishman always knows should knows all does englishman undoubtedly correct
italian self assured excitable easily forgets himself other people
russian self assured just knows nothing does want know anything since does believe anything can known
german self assurance worst all stronger more repulsive than other imagines knows truthscience himself invented absolute truth
pfuel evidently sort
sciencetheory oblique movements deduced from history frederick great wars all came across history more recent warfare seemed absurd barbarous monstrous collisions many blunders committed both sides wars could called wars did accord theory therefore could serve material science
1806 pfuel been one those responsible plan campaign ended jena auerst did see least proof fallibility theory disasters war
contrary deviations made from theory opinion sole cause whole disaster characteristically gleeful sarcasm would remark there said whole affair would devil pfuel one those theoreticians love their theory lose sight theory object practical application
love theory made hate everything practical would listen 
even pleased failures failures resulting from deviations practice from theoryonly proved accuracy theory
said few words prince andrew chern shev about present war air man knows beforehand all will wrong displeased should 
unbrushed tufts hair sticking behind hastily brushed hair temples expressed most eloquently
passed into next room deep querulous sounds voice once heard from there
prince andrew eyes still following pfuel out room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly nodding bolk nski pausing wentinto study giving instructions adjutant went
emperor following bennigsen hastened make preparations ready receive sovereign
chern shev prince andrew went out into porch where emperor looked fatigued dismounting
marquis paulucci talking particular warmth emperor head bent left listening dissatisfied air
emperor moved forward evidently wishing end conversation flushed excited italian oblivious decorum followed continued speak
man advised forming camp drissa camp said paulucci emperor mounted steps noticing prince andrew scanned unfamiliar face person sire
continued paulucci desperately apparently unable restrain himself man advised drissa camp see alternative lunatic asylum gallows without heeding end italian remarks though hearing emperor recognizing bolk nski addressed graciously
very glad see there where are meeting wait 
emperor went into study
followed prince peter mikh ylovich volk nski baron stein door closed behind 
prince andrew taking advantage emperor permission accompanied paulucci whom known turkey into drawing room where council assembled
prince peter mikh ylovich volk nski occupied position chief emperor staff
came out study into drawing room maps spread table put questions wished hear opinion gentlemen present
happened news afterwards proved false been received during night movement french outflank drissa camp
first speak general armfeldt meet difficulty presented itself unexpectedly proposed perfectly new position away from petersburg moscow roads
reason inexplicable unless wished show could opinion urged point army should unite there await enemy
plain armfeldt thought out plan long ago now expounded much answer questions put fact plan did answer avail himself opportunity air 
one millions proposals one good another could made long quite unknown character war would take
young count toll objected swedish general views more warmly than anyone else course dispute drew from side pocket well filled notebook asked permission read 
voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally different from armfeldt pfuel plan campaign
answer toll paulucci suggested advance attack urged could alone extricate from present uncertainty from trap called drissa camp situated
during all discussions pfuel interpreter wolzogen bridge court relations silent
pfuel only snorted contemptuously turned away show would never demean himself replying such nonsense now hearing
when prince volk nski chair called give opinion merely said why ask general armfeldt proposed splendid position exposed rear why italian gentleman attack very fine retreat also good why ask said 
why yourselves know everything better than 
when volk nski said frown emperor name asked opinion pfuel rose suddenly growing animated began speak everything been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought knew better than did now come mend matters there nothing mend principles laid down must strictly adhered said drumming table bony fingers
difficulty nonsense childishness went map speaking rapidly began proving eventuality could alter efficiency drissa camp everything been foreseen enemy really going outflank enemy would inevitably destroyed
paulucci did know german began questioning french
wolzogen came assistance chief spoke french badly began translating hardly able keep pace pfuel rapidly demonstrating only all happened all could happen been foreseen scheme there now difficulties whole fault lay fact plan been precisely executed
kept laughing sarcastically demonstrated last contemptuously ceased demonstrate like mathematician ceases prove various ways accuracy problem already been proved
wolzogen took place continued explain views frenchevery now turning pfuel saying your excellency pfuel like man heated fight strikes those own side shouted angrily own supporter wolzogen well course more there explain paulucci michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously french
armfeldt addressed pfuel german
toll explained volk nski russian
all men prince andrew sympathized most pfuel angry determined absurdly self confident 
all those present evidently alone seeking anything himself nursed hatred against anyone only desired plan formed theory arrived years toil should carried out
ridiculous unpleasantly sarcastic yet inspired involuntary respect boundless devotion idea
besides remarks all except pfuel one common trait been noticeable council war 1805 there now panic fear napoleon genius though concealed noticeable every rejoinder
everything assumed possible napoleon expected from every side invoked terrible name shatter each other proposals
pfuel alone seemed consider napoleon barbarian like everyone else opposed theory
besides feeling respect pfuel evoked pity prince andrew
from tone courtiers addressed way paulucci allowed himself speak emperor above all from certain desperation pfuel own expressions clear others knew pfuel himself felt fall hand
despite self confidence grumpy german sarcasm pitiable hair smoothly brushed temples sticking tufts behind
though concealed fact under show irritation contempt evidently despair sole remaining chance verifying theory huge experiment proving soundness whole world slipping away from 
discussions continued long time longer lasted more heated became disputes culminating shouts personalities less possible arrive general conclusion from all been said
prince andrew listening polyglot talk surmises plans refutations shouts felt nothing amazement saying
thought long since often occurred during military activities idea there cannot science war therefore there can such thing military genius now appeared obvious truth
theory science possible about matter conditions circumstances are unknown cannot defined especially when strength acting forces cannot ascertained one able foresee condition our enemy armies will day time one can gauge force detachment
sometimes when there coward front shout are cut off start running brave jolly lad shouts hurrah detachment five thousand worth thirty thousand sch grabern times fifty thousand run from eight thousand austerlitz
science can there matter all practical matters nothing can defined everything depends innumerable conditions significance determined particular moment arrives one knows when armfeldt says our army cut half paulucci says got french army between two fires michaud says worthlessness drissa camp lies having river behind pfuel says constitutes strength toll proposes one plan armfeldt another are all good all bad advantages suggestions can seen only moment trial
why all speak military genius man genius can order bread brought right time say right left only military men are invested pomp power crowds sychophants flatter power attributing qualities genius does possess
best generals known contrary stupid absent minded men
bagrati best napoleon himself admitted 
bonaparte himself remember limited self satisfied face field austerlitz
only does good army commander need special qualities contrary needs absence highest best human attributes love poetry tenderness philosophic inquiring doubt
should limited firmly convinced doing very important otherwise will sufficient patience only will brave leader
god forbid should humane should love pity think just unjust
understandable theory their genius invented long ago power success military action depends man ranks shouts are lost shouts hurrah only ranks can one serve assurance being useful
thought prince andrew listened talking roused himself only when paulucci called everyone leaving
review next day emperor asked prince andrew where would like serve prince andrew lost standing court circles forever asking remain attached sovereign person permission serve army
before beginning campaign rost received letter from parents told briefly nat sha illness breaking off engagement prince andrew explained nat sha having rejected again asked nicholas retire from army return home
receiving letter nicholas did even make attempt get leave absence retire from army wrote parents sorry nat sha ill engagement broken off would all could meet their wishes

troops retired from lna various complicated reasons state political strategic

one brother masons revealed pierre following prophecy concerning napoleon drawn from revelation 
chapter verse apocalypse said wisdom

fifth verse same chapter there given unto mouth speaking great things blasphemies power given unto continue forty two months
french alphabet written out same numerical values hebrew first nine letters denote units others tens will following significance writing words empereur napol numbers appears sum 666 napoleon therefore beast foretold apocalypse
moreover applying same system words quarante deux term allowed beast spoke great things blasphemies same number 666 obtained from followed limit fixed napoleon power come year 1812 when french emperor forty two
prophecy pleased pierre very much often asked himself would put end power beast napoleon tried same system using letters numbers adding find answer question engrossed 
wrote words empereur alexandre nation russe added their numbers sums either more less than 666
once when making such calculations wrote down own name french comte pierre besouhoff sum numbers did come right

omitting though incorrectly pierre got answer sought
russe besuhof made 666

returning home tya announced resolutely firmly allowed enter service would run away
next day count ily rost though yet quite yielded went inquire could arrange tya serve where there would least danger
two days later fifteenth july immense number carriages standing outside slob palace
great halls full
first nobility gentry their uniforms second bearded merchants full skirted coats blue cloth wearing medals
noblemen hall there incessant movement buzz voices
chief magnates sat high backed chairs large table under portrait emperor most gentry strolling about room

agitated extraordinary gathering only nobles also merchant class les tats raux states general evoked whole series ideas long laid aside deeply graven soul thoughts contrat social french revolution
words struck emperor appeal sovereign coming capital consultation people strengthened idea
imagining direction something important long awaited drawing near strolled about watching listening conversations nowhere finding confirmation ideas occupied 
emperor manifesto read evoking enthusiasm all moved about discussing 
besides ordinary topics conversation pierre heard questions where marshals nobility stand when emperor entered when ball should given emperor honor whether should group themselves districts whole provinces
soon war touched nobility been convened talk became undecided indefinite
all preferred listening speaking
middle aged man handsome virile uniform retired naval officer speaking one rooms small crowd pressing round 
pierre went circle formed round speaker listened
count ily rost military uniform catherine time sauntering pleasant smile among crowd all whom acquainted
approached group listened kindly smile nods approval always did speaker saying
retired naval man speaking very boldly evident from expression faces listeners from fact people pierre knew meekest quietest men walked away disapprovingly expressed disagreement 
pierre pushed way into middle group listened convinced himself man indeed liberal views quite different from own
naval officer spoke particularly sonorous musical aristocratic baritone voice pleasantly swallowing generally slurring consonants voice man calling out servant heah bwing pipe indicative dissipation exercise authority

count rost mouth watered pleasure nudged pierre pierre wanted speak himself
pushed forward feeling stirred yet sure stirred would say
scarcely opened mouth when one senators man without tooth head shrewd though angry expression standing near first speaker interrupted 
evidently accustomed managing debates maintaining argument began low distinct tones imagine sir said mumbling toothless mouth been summoned discuss whether best empire present moment adopt conscription call out militia
been summoned reply appeal our sovereign emperor honored 
judge best conscription militia can leave supreme authority
pierre suddenly saw outlet excitement
hardened heart against senator introducing set narrow attitude into deliberations nobility
pierre stepped forward interrupted 
himself did yet know would say began speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french expressing himself bookish russian
excuse your excellency began
well acquainted senator thought necessary occasion address formally
though don agree gentleman
hesitated wished say mon honorable opinant very honorable opponent gentleman
whom honor knowing suppose nobility been summoned merely express their sympathy enthusiasm also consider means can assist our fatherland imagine went warming subject emperor himself would satisfied find merely owners serfs whom are willing devote service chair canon are ready make ourselves obtain from counsel
many persons withdrew from circle noticing senator sarcastic smile freedom pierre remarks
only count rost pleased been pleased those naval officer senator general whatever speech last heard
think before discussing questions pierre continued should ask emperor most respectfully ask majesty let know number our troops position our army our forces now are 
scarcely pierre uttered words before attacked from three sides
most vigorous attack came from old acquaintance boston player always been well disposed toward step step novich adr ksin
adr ksin uniform whether result uniform from other cause pierre saw before quite different man
sudden expression malevolence aged face adr ksin shouted pierre first place tell right questionemperor about secondly russian nobility right emperor could answer such question
troops are moved according enemy movements number men increases decreases
another voice nobleman medium height about forty years age whom pierre formerly met gypsies knew bad cardplayer also transformed uniform came pierre interrupted adr ksin
yes time discussing continued acting there war russia enemy advancing destroy russia desecrate tombs our fathers carry off our wives children
will all arise everyone will our father tsar shouted rolling bloodshot eyes
are russians will grudge our blood defense our faith throne fatherland must cease raving are sons our fatherland will show europe russia rises defense russia pierre wished reply could get word
felt words apart from meaning conveyed less audible than sound opponent voice
count rost back crowd expressing approval several persons briskly turning shoulder orator end phrase said right quite right just pierre wished say ready sacrifice money serfs himself only one ought know state affairs order able improve unable speak
many voices shouted talked same time count rost time signify approval all group increased dispersed formed moved hum talk into largest hall big table
only pierre attempt speak unsuccessful rudely interrupted pushed aside people turned away from from common enemy
happened displeased substance speech even been forgotten after many subsequent speeches animate crowd needed tangible object love tangible object hate
many other orators spoke after excited nobleman all same tone
many spoke eloquently originality
nka editor russian messenger recognized cries author author heard crowd said hell must repulsed hell seen childsmiling lightning flashes thunderclaps will child
yes yes thunderclaps repeated approvingly back rows crowd
crowd drew large table sat gray haired bald seventy year old magnates uniformed besashed almost all whom pierre seen their own homes their buffoons playing boston clubs
incessant hum voices crowd advanced table
pressed throng against high backs chairs orators spoke one after another sometimes two together
those standing behind noticed speaker omitted say hastened supply 
others heat crush racked their brains find thought hastened utter 
old magnates whom pierre knew sat turned look first one another their faces most part only expressed fact found very hot
pierre however felt excited general desire show ready all lengths found expression tones looks more than substance speeches infected 
did renounce opinions felt himselfway blame wished justify himself
only said would more purpose make sacrifices when know needed said trying heard above other voices
one old men nearest looked round attention immediately diverted exclamation other side table
yes moscow will surrendered will our expiation shouted one man
enemy mankind cried another
gentlemen are crushing 
moment count rostopch protruding chin alert eyes wearing uniform general sash over shoulder entered room stepping briskly front crowd gentry
our sovereign emperor will moment said rostopch 
straight from palace
seeing position are think there little need discussion
emperor deigned summon merchants
millions will pour forth from there pointed merchants hall our business supply men spare ourselves
least can conference took place confined magnates sitting table
whole consultation passed more than quietly
after all preceding noise sound their old voices saying one after another agree variety opinion even mournful effect
secretary told write down resolution moscow nobility gentry would furnish ten men fully equipped out every thousand serfs smol nsk gentry done
their chairs made scraping noise gentlemen conferred rose apparent relief began walking down arm arm stretch their legs converse couples
emperor emperor sudden cry resounded through halls whole throng hurried entrance
emperor entered hall through broad path between two lines nobles
pierre stood rather far off could hear all emperor said
from did hear understood emperor spoke danger threatening empire hopes placed moscow nobility
answered voice informed resolution just arrived 
gentlemen said emperor quivering voice
there rustling among crowd again subsided pierre distinctly heard pleasantly human voice emperor saying emotion never doubted devotion russian nobles today surpassed expectations
thank name fatherland gentlemen let act time most precious
emperor ceased speaking crowd began pressing round rapturous exclamations heard from all sides
yes most precious
royal word said count rost sob
stood back though heard hardly anything understood everything own way
from hall nobility emperor went merchants
there remained about ten minutes
pierre among those saw come out from merchants hall tears emotion eyes
became known later scarcely begun address merchants before tears gushed from eyes concluded trembling voice
when pierre saw emperor coming out accompanied two merchants one whom pierre knew fat otkupshch 
other mayor man thin sallow face narrow beard
tears filled thin man eyes fat otkupshch sobbed outright like child kept repeating our lives property take your majesty pierre one feeling moment desire show ready all lengths prepared sacrifice everything
now felt ashamed speech constitutional tendency sought opportunity effacing 
having heard count mam nov furnishing regiment bez khov once informed rostopch would give thousand men their maintenance
old rost could tell wife passed without tears once consented tya request went himself enter name
next day emperor left moscow
assembled nobles all took off their uniforms settled down again their homes clubs without groans gave orders their stewards about enrollment feeling amazed themselves done
napoleon began war russia could resist going dresden could help having head turned homage received could help donning polish uniform yielding stimulating influence june morning could refrain from bursts anger presence kur kin balash 
alexander refused negotiations felt himself personally insulted
barclay tolly tried command army best way wished fulfill duty earn fame great commander
rost charged french could restrain wish gallop across level field same way innumerable people took part war acted accord their personal characteristics habits circumstances aims
moved fear vanity rejoiced indignant reasoned imagining knew doing did their own free will all involuntary tools history carrying work concealed from comprehensible 
such inevitable fate men action higher stand social hierarchy less are free
actors 1812 long since left stage their personal interests vanished leaving trace nothing remains time historic results
providence compelled all men striving attain personal aims further accomplishment stupendous result one all expected neither napoleon nor alexander nor still less those did actual fighting
cause destruction french army 1812 clear now
one will deny cause one hand advance into heart russia late season without preparation winter campaign other character given war burning russian towns hatred foe aroused among russian people
one time foresaw now seems evident only way army eight hundred thousand men best world led best general could destroyed conflict raw army half numerical strength led inexperienced commanders russian army 
only did one see russian side every effort made hinder only thing could save russia french side despite napoleon experience called military genius every effort directed pushing moscow end summer doing very thing bound lead destruction
historical works year 1812 french writers are very fond saying napoleon felt danger extending line sought battle marshals advised stop smol nsk making similar statements show danger campaign even understood
russian authors are still fonder telling from commencement campaign scythian war plan adopted lure napoleon into depths russia plan attribute pfuel others certain frenchman others toll others again alexander himself pointing notes projects letters contain hints such line action
all hints happened both from french side russian are advanced only fit event
event occurred hints would been forgotten forgotten thousands millions hints expectations contrary current now been forgotten event falsified 
there are always many conjectures issue event however may end there will always people say said would quite forgetting amid their innumerable conjectures many quite contrary effect
conjectures napoleon awareness danger extending line russian side luring enemy into depths russia are evidently kind only much straining can historians attribute such conceptions napoleon marshals such plans russian commanders
all facts are flat contradiction such conjectures
during whole period war only there wish russian side draw french into heart country from their first entry into russia everything done stop 
only napoleon afraid extend line welcomed every step forward triumph did seek battle eagerly former campaigns very lazily
very beginning war our armies divided our sole aim unite though uniting armies advantage meant retire lure enemy into depths country
our emperor joined army encourage defend every inch russian soil retreat
enormous drissa camp formed pfuel plan there intention retiring farther
emperor reproached commanders chief every step retired
could bear idea letting enemy even reach smol nsk still less could contemplate burning moscow when our armies did unite displeased smol nsk abandoned burned without general engagement having been fought under walls
thought emperor russian commanders people still more provoked thought our forces retreating into depths country
napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into country missed several chances forcing engagement
august smol nsk thought only advance farther though now see advance evidently ruinous 
facts clearly show napoleon did foresee danger advance moscow nor did alexander russian commanders think luring napoleon quite contrary
luring napoleon into depths country result plan one believed possible resulted from most complex interplay intrigues aims wishes among those took part war perception whatever inevitable one way saving russia
armies divided commencement campaign
tried unite evident intention giving battle checking enemy advance effort unite avoiding battle much stronger enemy necessarily withdrawing armies acute angle led french smol nsk
withdrew acute angle only french advanced between our two armies angle became still more acute withdrew still farther barclay tolly unpopular foreigner disliked bagrati would come under command bagrati being command second army tried postpone joining coming under barclay command long could
bagrati slow effecting junction though chief aim all headquarters alleged exposed army danger march best retire more left more south worrying enemy from flank rear securing from ukraine recruits army looks planned order come under command detested foreigner barclay whose rank inferior own
emperor army encourage presence ignorance steps take enormous number advisers plans destroyed first army energy retired
intention make stand drissa camp paulucci aiming becoming commander chief unexpectedly employed energy influence alexander pfuel whole plan abandoned command entrusted barclay
barclay did inspire confidence power limited
armies divided there unity command barclay unpopular from confusion division unpopularity foreign commander chief there resulted one hand indecision avoidance battle could refrained from armies been united someone else instead barclay been command other ever increasing indignation against foreigners increase patriotic zeal
last emperor left army most convenient indeed only pretext departure decided necessary inspire people capitals arouse nation general patriotic war
visit emperor moscow strength russian army trebled
left order obstruct commander chief undivided control army hoping more decisive action would taken command armies became still more confused enfeebled
bennigsen tsar vich swarm adjutants general remained army keep commander chief under observation arouse energy barclay feeling less free than ever under observation all eyes emperor became still more cautious undertaking decisive action avoided giving battle
barclay stood caution
tsar vich hinted treachery demanded general engagement
lubom rski bronn tski wlocki others group stirred much trouble barclay under pretext sending papers emperor dispatched polish adjutants general petersburg plunged into open struggle bennigsen tsar vich
smol nsk armies last reunited much bagrati disliked 
bagrati drove carriage house occupied barclay
barclay donned sash came out meet report senior officer bagrati 
despite seniority rank bagrati contest magnanimity took orders from barclay having submitted agreed less than ever
emperor orders bagrati reported direct 
wrote arakch emperor confidant must sovereign pleases cannot work minister meaning barclay 
god sake send somewhere else only command regiment
cannot stand 
headquarters are full germans russian cannot exist there sense anything
thought really serving sovereign fatherland turns out serving barclay
confess want 
swarm bronn tskis wintzingerodes their like still further embittered relations between commanders chief even less unity resulted
preparations made fight french before smol nsk
general hating barclay rode visit friend own corps commander having spent day returned barclay condemned unsuitable from every point view battleground seen
disputes intrigues going about future field battle looking french having lost touch french stumbled upon nev rovski division reached walls smol nsk
necessary fight unexpected battle smol nsk save our lines communication
battle fought thousands killed both sides
smol nsk abandoned contrary wishes emperor whole people
smol nsk burned own inhabitants been misled their governor
ruined inhabitants setting example other russians went moscow thinking only their own losses kindling hatred foe
napoleon advanced farther retired thus arriving very result caused destruction
day after son left prince nicholas sent princess mary come study

only night forests dew lasted there freshness
road highroad along troops marched there such freshness even night when road passed through forest dew imperceptible sandy dust churned more than six inches deep
soon day dawned march began
artillery baggage wagons moved noiselessly through deep dust rose very hubs wheels infantry sank ankle deep soft choking hot dust never cooled even night
dust kneaded feet wheels rest rose hung like cloud over troops settling eyes ears hair nostrils worst all lungs men beasts moved along road
higher sun rose higher rose cloud dust through screen hot fine particles one could look naked eye sun showed like huge crimson ball unclouded sky

seeing young master elder one frightened look clutched younger companion hand hid behind birch tree stopping pick green plums dropped
prince andrew turned away startled haste unwilling let see been observed
sorry pretty frightened little girl afraid looking yet felt irresistible desire 
new sensation comfort relief came over when seeing girls realized existence other human interests entirely aloof from own just legitimate those occupied 
evidently girls passionately desired one thing carry away eat those green plums without being caught prince andrew shared their wish success their enterprise
could resist looking once more
believing their danger past sprang from their ambush chirruping something their shrill little voices holding their skirts their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily quickly across meadow grass
prince andrew somewhat refreshed having ridden off dusty highroad along troops moving
far from bald hills again came out road overtook regiment halting place dam small pond

consider our retreat lost fatigue left hospital more than fifteen thousand men attacked would happened
tell god sake will russia our mother russia say our being frightened why are abandoning our good gallant fatherland such rabble implanting feelings hatred shame all our subjects are scared whom are afraid blame minister vacillating coward dense dilatory all bad qualities
whole army bewails calls down curses upon 
among innumerable categories applicable phenomena human life one may discriminate between those substance prevailsthose form prevails
latter distinguished from village country provincial even moscow life may allot petersburg life especially life salons
life salons unchanging
since year 1805 made peace again quarreled bonaparte made constitutions unmade again salons anna vlovna remained just been one seven other five years before
anna vlovna talked perplexity bonaparte successes just before saw subservience shown european sovereigns malicious conspiracy sole object cause unpleasantness anxiety court circle anna vlovna representative
salon rumy ntsev himself honored visits regarding remarkably intelligent woman talked same ecstasy 1812 1808 great nation great man regretted our rupture france rupture according ought promptly terminated peace
late since emperor return from army there been excitement conflicting salon circles demonstrations hostility one another each camp retained own tendency
anna vlovna circle only those frenchmen admitted deep rooted legitimists patriotic views expressed effect one ought french theater maintain french troupe costing government much whole army corps
progress war eagerly followed only reports most flattering our army circulated
french circle rumy ntsev reports cruelty enemy war contradicted all napoleon attempts conciliation discussed
circle discountenanced those advised hurried preparations removal kaz court girls educational establishments under patronage dowager empress
circle war general regarded series formal demonstrations would very soon end peace view prevailed expressed bil bin now petersburg quite home house every clever man obliged visit gunpowder those invented would matters settled
circle moscow enthusiasm news reached petersburg simultaneously emperor return ridiculed sarcastically very cleverly though much caution
anna vlovna circle contrary enraptured enthusiasm spoke plutarch speaks deeds ancients
prince vas still occupied former important posts formed connecting link between two circles
visited good friend anna vlovna well daughter diplomatic salon often constant comings goings between two camps became confused said should said anna vlovna vice versa
soon after emperor return prince vas conversation about war anna vlovna severely condemned barclay tolly undecided ought appointed commander chief
one visitors usually spoken man great merit having described day seen kut zov newly chosen chief petersburg militia presiding over enrollment recruits treasury cautiously ventured suggest kut zov would man satisfy all requirements
anna vlovna remarked melancholy smile kut zov done nothing cause emperor annoyance
talked talked assembly nobility prince vas interrupted did listen 
told election chief militia would please emperor
did listen 
all mania opposition went 
all want ape foolish enthusiasm those muscovites prince vas continued forgetting moment though one ridicule moscow enthusiasm anna vlovna one ecstatic about 
now suitable count kut zov oldest general russia should preside tribunal will get nothing pains could make man commander chief cannot mount horse drops asleep council very worst morals good reputation made himself bucharest don speak capacity general time like appoint decrepit blind old man positively blind fine idea blind general can see anything
play blindman buff can see all one replied remarks
quite correct twenty fourth july
twenty ninth july kut zov received title prince
might indicate wish get rid therefore prince vas opinion continued correct though now hurry express 
eighth august committee consisting field marshal saltyk arakch vyazm tinov lopukh kochub met consider progress war
committee came conclusion our failures due want unity command though members committee aware emperor dislike kut zov after short deliberation agreed advise appointment commander chief
same day kut zov appointed commander chief full powers over armies over whole region occupied 
ninth august prince vas anna vlovna again met man great merit
latter very attentive anna vlovna wanted appointed director one educational establishments young ladies
prince vas entered room air happy conqueror attained object desires
well heard great news prince kut zov field marshal all dissensions are end glad delighted last man said glancing sternly significantly round everyone drawing room
man great merit despite desire obtain post director could refrain from reminding prince vas former opinion
though impolite prince vas anna vlovna drawing room also anna vlovna herself received news delight could resist temptation
prince say blind said reminding prince vas own words
nonsense sees well enough said prince vas rapidly deep voice slight cough voice cough wont dispose all difficulties
sees well enough added
pleased about went our sovereign given full powers over all armies whole region powers commander chief ever before
second autocrat concluded victorious smile
god grant god grant said anna vlovna
man great merit still novice court circles wishing flatter anna vlovna defending former position question observed said emperor reluctant give kut zov those powers
say blushed like girl whom joconde read when said kut zov your emperor fatherland award honor
perhaps heart took part speech said anna vlovna
warmly rejoined prince vas would now yield kut zov anyone opinion kut zov only admirable himself adored everybody
impossible said our sovereign appreciated highly before
god grant only prince kut zov assumes real power does allow anyone put spoke wheel observed anna vlovna
understanding once whom alluded prince vas said whisper know fact kut zov made absolute condition tsar vich should army
know said emperorprince vas repeated words supposed been spoken kut zov emperor
can neither punish does wrong nor reward does right
very wise man prince kut zov known long time even say remarked man great merit did yet possess courtly tact excellency made express condition sovereign himself should army
soon said both prince vas anna vlovna turned away from glanced sadly one another sigh vet 
taking place petersburg french already passed smol nsk drawing nearer nearer moscow
napoleon historian thiers like other historians trying justify hero says drawn walls moscow against will
right other historians look explanation historic events will one man right russian historians maintain napoleon drawn moscow skill russian commanders
besides law retrospection regards all past preparation events subsequently occur law reciprocity comes confusing whole matter
good chessplayer having lost game sincerely convinced loss resulted from mistake made looks mistake opening forgets each stage game there similar mistakes none moves perfect
only notices mistake pays attention opponent took advantage 
much more complex than game war occurs under certain limits time where one will manipulates lifeless objects everything results from innumerable conflicts various wills after smol nsk napoleon sought battle beyond dorogob zma revo zaym shche happened owing conjunction innumerable circumstances russians could give battle till reached borodin seventy miles from moscow
from zma napoleon ordered direct advance moscow

lavr shka one those coarse bare faced lackeys seen all sorts things consider necessary everything mean cunning way are ready render sort service their master are keen guessing their master baser impulses especially those prompted vanity pettiness
finding himself company napoleon whose identity easily surely recognized lavr shka least abashed merely did utmost gain new master favor

when napoleon asked whether russians thought would beat bonaparte lavr shka screwed eyes considered
question saw subtle cunning men type see cunning everything frowned did answer immediately
like said thoughtfully there battle soon yours will win
three days pass after well same battle will soon over
lelorgne ideville smilingly interpreted speech napoleon thus battle takes place within next three days french will win later god knows will happen
napoleon did smile though evidently high good humor ordered words repeated
lavr shka noticed entertain further pretending know napoleon added know bonaparte beaten everybody world are different matter
without knowing why bit boastful patriotism slipped out end
interpreter translated words without last phrase bonaparte smiled
young cossack made mighty interlocutor smile says thiers

soon napoleon interpreter spoken says thiers cossack seized amazement did utter another word rode eyes fixed conqueror whose fame reached across steppes east
all loquacity suddenly arrested replaced silent feeling admiration
napoleon after making cossack present set free like bird restored native fields
napoleon rode dreaming moscow appealed imagination bird restored native fields galloped our outposts inventing way all taken place meant relate comrades

thought only one thing sorrow after break caused cares present seemed already belong past
now could remember weep pray
after sunset wind dropped
toward midnight voices began subside cock crowed full moon began show from behind lime trees fresh white dewy mist began rise stillness reigned over village house
pictures near past father illness last moments rose one after another memory
mournful pleasure now lingered over images repelling horror only last one picture death felt could contemplate even imagination still mystic hour night
pictures presented themselves clearly such detail seemed now present now past now future
vividly recalled moment when first stroke being dragged along armpits through garden bald hills muttering something helpless tongue twitching gray eyebrows looking uneasily timidly 
even wanted tell told day died thought

all den sov said clever point
general saying even more clever point evident kut zov despised knowledgecleverness knew something else would decide matter something independent cleverness knowledge
prince andrew watched commander chief face attentively only expression could see there one boredom curiosity meaning feminine whispering behind door desire observe propriety
evident kut zov despised cleverness learning even patriotic feeling shown den sov despised own intellect feelings knowledge did try display something else
despised old age experience life
only instruction kut zov gave own accord during report referred looting russian troops
end report general put before signature paper relating recovery payment from army commanders green oats mown down soldiers when landowners lodged petitions compensation
after hearing matter kut zov smacked lips together shook head

give time give time said grim look evidently wishing continue agitating conversation added sent keep 
thank your serene highness fear longer fit staff replied prince andrew smile kut zov noticed
kut zov glanced inquiringly 
above all added prince andrew grown used regiment fond officers fancy men also like

decline honor being believe 
shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit kut zov podgy face
sorry need 
right right men are needed
regiments would are would advisers served there 
remember yes remember standard said kut zov flush pleasure suffused prince andrew face recollection
taking hand drawing downwards kut zov offered cheek kissed again prince andrew noticed tears old man eyes
though prince andrew knew kut zov tears came easily particularly tender considerate from wish show sympathy loss yet reminder austerlitz both pleasant flattering 
your way god 
know your path path honor paused
missed bucharest needed someone send
changing subject kut zov began speak turkish war peace been concluded
yes been much blamed said both war peace
tout vient point celui qui sait attendre
there many advisers there 
went returning subject advisers evidently occupied 
listened all should made peace turkey should been through war
everything haste more haste less speed
menski would been lost died
stormed fortresses thirty thousand men
difficult capture fortress difficult win campaign
storming attacking patience time are wanted
menski sent soldiers rustchuk only employed two things took more fortresses than menski made turks eat horseflesh swayed head
french shall believe went growing warmer beating chest make eat horseflesh tears again dimmed eyes
shan accept battle remarked prince andrew
shall everybody wants can helped

advisers entendent pas cette oreille voil mal
one asked evidently expecting answer
well want repeated eye shone deep shrewd look
tell continued prince andrew still did reply will tell 
dans doute mon cher paused abstiens toi articulated french proverb deliberately
well good dear fellow remember all heart share your sorrow serene highness nor prince nor commander chief father want anything come straight 
again embraced kissed prince andrew before latter left room kut zov gave sigh relief went unfinished novel les chevaliers cygne madame genlis
prince andrew could explained why after interview kut zov went back regiment reassured general course affairs man whom been entrusted
more realized absence all personal motive old man whom there seemed remain only habit passions place intellect grouping events drawing conclusions only capacity calmly contemplate course events more reassured everything would should
will bring plan own
will devise undertake anything thought prince andrew will hear everything remember everything put everything place
will hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful
understands there something stronger more important than own will inevitable course events can see grasp their significance seeing significance can refrain from meddling renounce personal wish directed something else
above all thought prince andrew one believes russian despite novel genlis french proverbs voice shook when said brought sob when said would make eat horseflesh such feelings more less dimly shared all unanimity general approval founded despite court influences popular choice kut zov commander chief received
after emperor left moscow life flowed there usual course course very usual difficult remember recent days patriotic elation ardor hard believe russia really danger members english club also sons fatherland ready sacrifice everything 
one thing recalled patriotic fervor everyone displayed during emperor stay call contributions men money necessity soon promises been made assumed legal official form became unavoidable
enemy approach moscow moscovites view their situation did grow more serious contrary became even more frivolous always happens people see great danger approaching
approach danger there are always two voices speak equal power human soul one very reasonably tells man consider nature danger means escaping other still more reasonably says depressing painful think danger since man power foresee everything avert general course events therefore better disregard painful till comes think about pleasant

words showed pierre clearly first time french would enter moscow
second broadsheet stated our headquarters zma count wittgenstein defeated french many inhabitants moscow wished armed weapons ready arsenal sabers pistols muskets could low price
tone proclamation jocose former chig rin talks
pierre pondered over broadsheets
evidently terrible stormcloud desired whole strength soul yet aroused involuntary horror drawing near

took pack cards lay table began lay out game patience
patience comes out said himself after shuffling cards holding hand lifting head comes out means

cajolery brought barbara novna told mob near killed said something french

although patience did come out pierre did join army remained deserted moscow ever same state agitation irresolution alarm yet same time joyfully expecting something terrible
next day toward evening princess set off pierre head steward came inform money needed equipment regiment could found without selling one estates
general head steward made out pierre project raising regiment would ruin 
pierre listened scarcely able repress smile
well sell said 
done can draw back now worse everything became especially own affairs better pierre pleased more evident catastrophe expected approaching
julie gone princess mary
intimate friends only rost remained did see 
distract thoughts drove dayvillage voronts see great balloon leppich constructing destroy foe trial balloon next day
balloon yet ready pierre learned being constructed emperor desire
emperor written count rostopch follows soon leppich ready get together crew reliable intelligent men car send courier general kut zov let know
please impress upon leppich very careful where descends first time may make mistake fall into enemy hands
essential combine movements those commander chief
way home from voronts passing bol tnoe place pierre seeing large crowd round bnoe place stopped got out trap
french cook accused being spy being flogged
flogging only just over executioner releasing from flogging bench stout man red whiskers blue stockings green jacket moaning piteously
another criminal thin pale stood near
frightened suffering look resembling thin frenchman face pierre pushed way through crowd
kept asking
attention crowd officials burghers shopkeepers peasants women cloaks pelisses eagerly centered passing bnoe place one answered 
stout man rose frowned shrugged shoulders evidently trying appear firm began pull jacket without looking about suddenly lips trembled began cry way full blooded grown men cry though angry himself doing 
crowd people began talking loudly stifle their feelings pity seemed pierre
cook prince
mounseer russian sauce seems sour frenchman
sets teeth edge said wrinkled clerk standing behind pierre when frenchman began cry
clerk glanced round evidently hoping joke would appreciated
people began laugh others continued watch dismay executioner undressing other man
pierre choked face puckered turned hastily away went back trap muttering something himself went took seat
drove along shuddered exclaimed several times audibly coachman asked your pleasure where are going shouted pierre man driving luby nka street
governor ordered answered coachman
fool idiot shouted pierre abusing coachman thing rarely did
home told drive faster blockhead must get away very day murmured himself
sight tortured frenchman crowd surrounding bnoe place pierre definitely made mind could longer remain moscow would leave army very day seemed either told coachman man ought known himself
reaching home pierre gave orders evst fey head coachman knew everything could anything known all moscow would leave night army mozh ysk saddle horses should sent there
could all arranged day evst fey representation pierre put off departure till next day allow time relay horses sent advance
twenty fourth weather cleared after spell rain after dinner pierre left moscow
when changing horses night perkh shkovo learned there been great battle evening
battle shev rdino
told there perkh shkovo earth trembled from firing nobody could answer questions won
dawn next day pierre approaching mozh ysk
every house mozh ysk soldiers quartered hostel where pierre met groom coachman there room 
everywhere mozh ysk beyond troops stationed march
cossacks foot horse soldiers wagons caissons cannon everywhere
pierre pushed forward fast could farther left moscow behind deeper plunged into sea troops more overcome restless agitation new joyful feeling experienced before
feeling akin felt slob palace during emperor visit sense necessity undertaking somethingsacrificing something
now experienced glad consciousness everything constitutes men happiness comforts life wealth even life itself rubbish pleasant throw away compared something
pierre could say did try determine whom felt such particular delight sacrificing everything
occupied question sacrifice fact sacrificing itself afforded new joyous sensation
twenty fourth august battle shev rdino redoubt fought twenty fifth shot fired either side twenty sixth battle borodin itself took place
why battles shev rdino borodin given accepted why battle borodin fought there least sense either french russians
immediate result russians bound brought nearer destruction moscow feared more than anything worldfrench immediate result brought nearer destruction their whole army feared more than anything world
result must quite obvious yet napoleon offered kut zov accepted battle
commanders been guided reason would seem must been obvious napoleon advancing thirteen hundred miles giving battle probability losing quarter army advancing certain destruction must been equally clear kut zov accepting battle risking loss quarter army would certainly lose moscow
kut zov mathematically clear when playing draughts one man less exchanging shall certainly lose therefore should exchange
when opponent sixteen men fourteen only one eighth weaker than when exchanged thirteen more men will three times strong 
before battle borodin our strength proportion french about five six after battle little more than one two previously hundred thousandagainst hundred twenty thousandafterwards little more than fifty thousandagainst hundred thousand
yet shrewd experienced kut zov accepted battle napoleon said commander genius gave losing quarter army lengthening lines communication still more
said expected end campaign occupying moscow ended previous campaign occupying vienna there much evidence contrary
napoleon historians themselves tell from smol nsk onwards wished stop knew danger extended position knew occupation moscow would end campaign seen smol nsk state russian towns left received single reply repeated announcements wish negotiate
giving accepting battle borodin kut zov acted involuntarily irrationally
later fit occurred historians provided cunningly devised evidence foresight genius generals all blind tools history most enslaved involuntary
ancients left model heroic poems heroes furnish whole interest story are still unable accustom ourselves fact our epoch histories kind are meaningless
other question battle borodin preceding battle shev rdino fought there also exists definite well known quite false conception
all historians describe affair follows russian army say retreat from smol nsk sought out itself best position general engagement found such position borodin 
russians say fortified position advance left highroad from moscow smol nsk almost right angle from borodin tsa very place where battle fought
front position say fortified outpost set shev rdino mound observe enemy
twenty fourth are told napoleon attacked advanced post took twenty sixth attacked whole russian army position field borodin 
histories say all quite wrong anyone cares look into matter can easily convince himself
russians did seek out best position contrary during retreat passed many positions better than borodin 
did stop one positions kut zov did wish occupy position himself chosen popular demand battle yet expressed itself strongly enough milor dovich yet arrived militia many other reasons
fact other positions passed stronger position borodin one where battle fought far from being strong more position than other spot one might find russian empire sticking pin into map hazard
only did russians fortify position field borodin left right angle highroad position battle took place never till twenty fifth august 1812 did think battle might fought there
shown first fact there entrenchments there twenty fifth those begun twenty fifth twenty sixth completed secondly position shev rdino redoubt
redoubt quite senseless front position where battle accepted
why more strongly fortified than other post why all efforts exhausted six thousand men sacrificed defend till late night twenty fourth cossack patrol would sufficed observe enemy
thirdly proof positionbattle fought been foreseen shev rdino redoubt advanced post positionfact twenty fifth barclay tolly bagrati convinced shev rdino redoubt left flank positionkut zov himself report written hot haste after battle speaks shev rdino redoubt left flank position
much later when reports battle borodin written leisure incorrect extraordinary statement invented probably justify mistakes commander chief represented infallible shev rdino redoubt advanced post whereas reality simply fortified point left flank battle borodin fought entrenched position previously selected whereas fought quite unexpected spot almost unentrenched
case evidently position selected along river koloch crosses highroad right angle acute angle left flank shev rdino right flank near village voe center borodin confluence rivers koloch yna
anyone looks field borodin without thinking battle actually fought position protected river koloch presents itself obvious army whose object prevent enemy from advancing along smol nsk road moscow
napoleon riding val evo twenty fourth did see history books say did position russians from tsa borodin could seen position did exist nor did see advanced post russian army pursuing russian rearguard came upon left flank russian position shev rdino redoubt unexpectedly russians moved army across koloch 
russians having time begin general engagement withdrew their left wing from position intended occupy took new position been foreseen fortified
crossing other side koloch left highroad napoleon shifted whole forthcoming battle from right left looking from russian side transferred plain between tsa sem novsk borodin plain more advantageous position than other plain russia there whole battle twenty sixth august took place
napoleon ridden out evening twenty fourth koloch ordered immediate attack redoubt begun attack next morning one would doubted shev rdino redoubt left flank our position battle would taken place where expected 
case should probably defended shev rdino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately
should attacked napoleon center right engagement would taken place twenty fifth position intended fortified
attack our left flank took place evening after retreat our rear guard immediately after fight gridn russian commanders did wish time begin general engagement evening twenty fourth first chief action battle borodin already lost twenty fourth obviously led loss one fought twenty sixth
after loss shev rdino redoubt found ourselves morning twenty fifth without position our left flank forced bend back hastily entrench where chanced 
only russian army twenty sixth defended weak unfinished entrenchments disadvantage position increased fact russian commanders having fully realized happened namely loss our position left flank shifting whole field forthcoming battlefrom right left maintained their extended position from village voe tsa consequently move their forces from right left during battle
happened throughout whole battle russians opposed entire french army launched against our left flank half many men
poniatowski action against tsa rov right flank against french actions distinct from main course battle
battle borodin did take place all effort conceal our commanders mistakes even cost diminishing glory due russian army people been described
battle borodin fought chosen entrenched position forces only slightly weaker than those enemy result loss shev rdino redoubt russians fought battle borodin open almost unentrenched position forces only half numerous french say under conditions merely unthinkable fight ten hours secure indecisive result unthinkable keep army even from complete disintegration flight
morning twenty fifth pierre leaving mozh ysk
descent high steep hill down winding road led out town past cathedral right where service being held bells ringing pierre got out vehicle proceeded foot
behind cavalry regiment coming down hill preceded singers
coming toward train carts carrying men been wounded engagement day before
peasant drivers shouting lashing their horses kept crossing from sideside
carts each three four wounded soldiers lying sitting jolted over stones been thrown steep incline make something like road
wounded bandaged rags pale cheeks compressed lips knitted brows held sides carts jolted against one another
almost all stared childlike curiosity pierre white hat green swallow tail coat
pierre coachman shouted angrily convoy wounded keep one side road
cavalry regiment descended hill singers surrounded pierre carriage blocked road
pierre stopped being pressed against side cutting road ran
sunshine from behind hill did penetrate into cutting there cold damp above pierre head bright august sunshine bells sounded merrily
one carts wounded stopped side road close pierre
driver bast shoes ran panting placed stone under one tireless hind wheels began arranging breech band little horse
one wounded old soldier bandaged arm following cart foot caught hold sound hand turned look pierre
say fellow countryman will set down take moscow asked
pierre deep thought did hear question
looking now cavalry regiment met convoy wounded now cart standing two wounded men sitting one lying
one those sitting cart probably been wounded cheek
whole headwrapped rags one cheek swollen size baby head
nose mouth twisted one side
soldier looking cathedral crossing himself
another young lad fair haired recruit white though there blood thin face looked pierre kindly fixed smile
third lay prone face visible
cavalry singers passing close sang their soldiers dance song
responding different sort merrimentmetallic sound bells reverberated high above hot rays sun bathed top opposite slope yet another sort merriment
beneath slope cart wounded near panting little nag where pierre stood damp somber sad
soldier swollen cheek looked angrily cavalry singers
coxcombs muttered reproachfully
soldiers only seen peasants today 
peasants even said soldier behind cart addressing pierre sad smile
want whole nation fall word moscow want make end 
spite obscurity soldier words pierre understood wanted say nodded approval
road clear again pierre descended hill drove 
kept looking either side road familiar faces only saw everywhere unfamiliar faces various military men different branches service all looked astonishment white hat green tail coat
having gone nearly three miles last met acquaintance eagerly addressed 
driving toward pierre covered gig sitting beside young surgeon recognizing pierre told cossack occupied driver seat pull 
count your excellency come asked doctor

pierre got out talked doctor explaining intention taking part battle
doctor advised apply direct kut zov

out army hundred thousandmust expect least twenty thousandwounded haven stretchers bunks dressers doctors enough six thousand
ten thousand carts need other things well must manage best can strange thought thousands men young old stared merry surprise hat perhaps very men noticed twenty thousand inevitably doomed wounds death amazed pierre
may die tomorrow why are thinking anything death latent sequence thought descent mozh ysk hill carts wounded ringing bells slanting rays sun songs cavalrymen vividly recurred mind
cavalry ride battle meet woundedmoment think awaits pass winking wounded
yet from among men twenty thousand are doomed die wonder hat strange thought pierre continuing way tat rinova
front landowner house left road stood carriages wagons crowds orderlies sentinels
commander chief putting there just when pierre arrived hardly staff there gone church service
pierre drove toward rki
when ascended hill reached little village street saw first time peasant militiamen their white shirts crosses their caps talking laughing loudly animated perspiring work huge knoll overgrown grass right road
digging others wheeling barrowloads earth along planks others stood about doing nothing
two officers standing knoll directing men
seeing peasants evidently still amused novelty their position soldiers pierre once more thought wounded men mozh ysk understood soldier meant when said want whole nation fall 
sight bearded peasants work battlefield their queer clumsy boots perspiring necks their shirts opening from left toward middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed pierre more strongly solemnity importance moment than anything yet seen heard
pierre stepped out carriage passing toiling militiamen ascended knoll from according doctor battlefield could seen
about eleven clock
sun shone somewhat left behind brightly lit enormous panorama rising like amphitheater extended before clear rarefied atmosphere
from above left bisecting amphitheater wound smol nsk highroad passing through village white church five hundred paces front knoll below 
below village road crossed river bridge winding down rose higher higher village val evo visible about four miles away where napoleon stationed
beyond val evo road disappeared into yellowing forest horizon
far distance birch fir forest right road cross belfry koloch monastery gleamed sun
there over whole blue expanse right left forest road smoking campfires could seen indefinite masses troops ours enemy 
ground right along course koloch moskv rivers broken hilly
between hollows villages bez bova zakh rino showed distance
left ground more level there fields grain smoking ruins sem novsk been burned down could seen
all pierre saw indefinite neither left nor right side field fully satisfied expectations
nowhere could see battlefield expected find only fields meadows troops woods smoke campfires villages mounds streams try would could descry military position place teemed life nor could even distinguish our troops from enemy 
must ask someone knows thought addressed officer looking curiosity huge unmilitary figure

elderly sergeant approached officer giving explanations waited silence finish speaking point evidently liking officer remark interrupted 
gabions must sent said sternly
officer appeared abashed though understood one might think many men would missing tomorrow ought speak

minute
voices suddenly heard saying officers soldiers militiamen began running forward along road
church procession coming hill from borodin 
first along dusty road came infantry ranks bareheaded arms reversed
from behind came sound church singing

higher command there two sharply defined parties kut zov party bennigsen chief staff
bor belonged latter one else showing servile respect kut zov could create impression old fellow much good bennigsen managed everything
now decisive moment battle come when kut zov would destroyed power pass bennigseneven kut zov won battle would felt everything done bennigsen

bor full nervous vivacity all day
after kays rov others whom pierre knew came time reply all questions about moscow showered upon listen all told 
faces all expressed animation apprehension seemed pierre cause excitement shown faces lay chiefly questions personal success mind however occupied different expression saw other faces expression spoke personal matters universal questions life death
kut zov noticed pierre figure group gathered round

wonderful matchless people said kut zov closed eyes swayed head
matchless people repeated sigh
want smell gunpowder said pierre
yes pleasant smell

often happens old people kut zov began looking about absent mindedly forgetting all wanted say 
evidently remembering wanted beckoned andrew kays rov adjutant brother
those verses
those wrote about ger kov lectures corps inditing 
recite recite said evidently preparing laugh
kays rov recited
kut zov smilingly nodded head rhythm verses
when pierre left kut zov lokhov came took hand
very glad meet count said aloud regardless presence strangers particularly resolute solemn tone
eve day when god alone knows fated survive glad opportunity tell regret misunderstandings occurred between should wish ill feeling 
pierre looked lokhov smile knowing say 
tears eyes lokhov embraced pierre kissed 
bor said few words general count bennigsen turned pierre proposed should ride along line
will interest said 
yes very much replied pierre
half hour later kut zov left tat rinova bennigsen suite pierre among set out their ride along line
from rki bennigsen descended highroad bridge when looked from hill officer pointed out being center our position where rows fragrant new mown hay lay riverside
rode across bridge into village borodin thence turned left passing enormous number troops guns came high knoll where militiamen digging
redoubt yet unnamed afterwards became known vski redoubt knoll battery pierre paid special attention 
did know would become more memorable than other spot plain borodin 
crossed hollow sem novsk where soldiers dragging away last logs from huts barns
rode downhill uphill across ryefield trodden beaten down hail following track freshly made artillery over furrows plowed land reached ches still being dug
ches bennigsen stopped began looking shev rdino redoubt opposite been ours day before where several horsemen could descried
officers said either napoleon murat there all gazed eagerly little group horsemen
pierre also looked trying guess scarcely discernible figures napoleon
last those mounted men rode away from mound disappeared
bennigsen spoke general approached began explaining whole position our troops
pierre listened straining each faculty understand essential points impending battle mortified feel mental capacity inadequate task
bennigsen stopped speaking noticing pierre listening suddenly said don think interests contrary very interesting replied pierre quite truthfully
from ches rode still farther left along road winding through thick low growing birch wood
middle wood brown hare white feet sprang out scared tramp many horses grew confused leaped along road front time arousing general attention laughter only when several voices shouted did dart one side disappear thicket
after going through wood about mile half came out glade where troops chkov corps stationed defend left flank
extreme left flank bennigsen talked great deal much heat seemed pierre gave orders great military importance
front chkov troopshigh ground occupied troops
bennigsen loudly criticized mistake saying madness leave height commanded country around unoccupied place troops below 
generals expressed same opinion
one particular declared martial heat put there slaughtered
bennigsen own authority ordered troops occupy high ground
disposition left flank increased pierre doubt own capacity understand military matters
listening bennigsen generals criticizing position troops behind hill quite understood shared their opinion very reason could understand man put there behind hill could made gross palpable blunder
pierre did know troops bennigsen supposed put there defend position concealed position ambush should seen might able strike approaching enemy unexpectedly
bennigsen did know moved troops forward according own ideas without mentioning matter commander chief
bright evening august prince andrew lay leaning elbow broken down shed village knyazk further end regiment encampment
through gap broken wall could see beside wooden fence row thirty year old birches their lower branches lopped off field shocks oats standing bushes near rose smoke campfires soldiers kitchens
narrow burdensome useless anyone life now seemed prince andrew eve battle felt agitated irritable done seven years before austerlitz
received given orders next day battle nothing more 
thoughts simplest clearest therefore most terrible thoughts would give peace
knew tomorrow battle would most terrible all taken part first time life possibility death presented itself relation worldly matter reference effect others simply relation himself own soul vividly plainly terribly almost certainty
from height perception all previously tormented preoccupied suddenly became illumined cold white light without shadows without perspective without distinction outline
all life appeared like magic lantern pictures long been gazing artificial light through glass
now suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures clear daylight without glass
yes yes there are those false images agitated enraptured tormented said himself passing review principal pictures magic lantern life regarding now cold white daylight clear perception death
there are those rudely painted figures once seemed splendid mysterious
glory good society love woman fatherland itself important pictures appeared profound meaning seemed filled all simple pale crude cold white light morning feel dawning 
three great sorrows life held attention particular love woman father death french invasion overrun half russia
little girl seemed brimming over mystic forces yes indeed loved 
made romantic plans love happiness boy said aloud bitterly
believed ideal love keep faithful whole year absence like gentle dove fable pine apart from 
all very simple horrible
when father built bald hills thought place land air peasants
napoleon came swept aside unconscious existence might brush chip from path bald hills whole life fell pieces
princess mary says trial sent from above
trial when will never return whom trial intended fatherland destruction moscow tomorrow shall killed perhaps even frenchman one our own men soldier discharging musket close ear one did yesterday french will come take head heels fling into hole may stink under their noses new conditions life will arise will seem quite ordinary others about shall know nothing
looked row birches shining sunshine their motionless green yellow foliage white bark
killed tomorrow
all should still 
birches their light shade curly clouds smoke campfires all around changed seemed terrible menacing
rose quickly went out shed began walk about
after returned voices heard outside shed
cried
red nosed captain tim khin formerly lokhov squadron commander now from lack officers battalion commander shyly entered shed followed adjutant regimental paymaster
prince andrew rose hastily listened business come about gave further instructions about dismiss when heard familiar lisping voice behind shed
devil take said voice man stumbling over something
prince andrew looked out shed saw pierre tripped over pole ground nearly fallen coming way
unpleasant prince andrew meet people own set general pierre especially reminded all painful moments last visit moscow
surprise said 
brings unexpected said eyes face expressed more than coldness expressed hostility pierre noticed once
approached shed full animation seeing prince andrew face felt constrained ill ease
come
interests said pierre often day senselessly repeated word interesting
yes masonic brothers say about war would stop said prince andrew sarcastically
well moscow people reached moscow last asked seriously
yes 
went see missed 
officers about take leave prince andrew apparently reluctant left alone friend asked stay tea
officers gazed surprise pierre huge stout figure listened talk moscow position our army round ridden
prince andrew remained silent expression forbidding pierre addressed remarks chiefly good natured battalion commander
understand whole position our troops prince andrew interrupted 
yes mean said pierre
being military man can say understood fully understand general position
well know more than anyone else may said prince andrew
said pierre looking over spectacles perplexity prince andrew
well think kut zov appointment asked
very glad appointment all know replied prince andrew
tell your opinion barclay tolly
moscow are saying heaven knows about 
think ask replied prince andrew indicating officers
pierre looked tim khin condescendingly interrogative smile everybody involuntarily addressed officer
see light again since serenity been appointed your excellency said tim khin timidly continually turning glance colonel
why asked pierre
well mention only firewood fodder let inform 
why when retreating from sventsy dare touch stick wisp hay anything
see going away would get all wasn your excellency again tim khin turned prince
daren 
our regiment two officers court martialed kind thing
when serenity took command everything became straightforward
why forbidden tim khin looked about confusion knowing answer such question
why lay waste country abandoning enemy said prince andrew venomous irony
very sound one can permit land pillaged accustom troops marauding
smol nsk judged correctly french might outflank larger forces
could understand cried prince andrew shrill voice seemed escape involuntarily could understand there first time fighting russian soil there spirit men such never seen before held french two days success increased our strength tenfold
ordered retreat all our efforts losses went nothing
thought betraying tried best could thought out everything why unsuitable
unsuitable now just plans out everything very thoroughly accurately every german 
well say your father german valet splendid valet satisfies your father requirements better than could all right let serve
your father mortally sick send valet away attend your father your own unpracticed awkward hands will soothe better than skilled man stranger could
russia well foreigner could serve splendid minister soon danger needs one own kin
your club been making out traitor slander traitor only result will afterwards ashamed their false accusations will make out hero genius instead traitor will still more unjust
honest very punctilious german
say skillful commander rejoined pierre
don understand meant skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically
skillful commander replied pierre
why one foresees all contingencies
impossible said prince andrew matter settled long ago
pierre looked surprise
yet say war like game chess remarked
yes replied prince andrew little difference chess may think over each move long please are limited time difference knight always stronger than pawn two pawns are always stronger than one war battalion sometimes stronger than division sometimes weaker than company
relative strength bodies troops can never known anyone
believe went things depended arrangements made staff should there making arrangements instead honor serve regiment gentlemen consider tomorrow battle will depend those others
success never depends never will depend positionequipment even numbers least all position
feeling pointed tim khin each soldier
prince andrew glanced tim khin looked commander alarm bewilderment
contrast former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now seemed excited
could apparently refrain from expressing thoughts suddenly occurred 
battle won those firmly resolve win why did lose battle austerlitz french losses almost equal ours very early said ourselves losing battle did lose 
said nothing fight there wanted get away from battlefield soon could
lost let run ran
said till evening heaven knows might happened
tomorrow shan say talk about our position left flank weak right flank extended went 
all nonsense there nothing kind
awaits tomorrow hundred million most diverse chances will decided instant fact our men theirs run run man man killed all being done present only play
fact those men whom ridden round position only help matters hinder
are only concerned their own petty interests
such moment said pierre reproachfully
such moment prince andrew repeated
only moment affording opportunities undermine rival obtain extra cross ribbon
tomorrow means russian army hundred thousand french army hundred thousand met fight thing two hundred thousand men will fight side fights more fiercely spares itself least will win
like will tell whatever happens whatever muddles those top may make shall win tomorrow battle
tomorrow happen may shall win there now your excellency truth real truth said tim khin
would spare himself now soldiers battalion believe wouldn drink their vodka day say
all silent
prince andrew went out shed giving final orders adjutant
after gone pierre approached prince andrew about start conversation when heard clatter three horses hoofs road far from shed looking direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen clausewitz accompanied cossack
rode close continuing converse prince andrew involuntarily heard words der krieg muss raum verlegt werden
der ansicht kann ich nicht genug preis geben said one 
said other der zweck ist nur den feind schw chen kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privat personen achtung nehmen
agreed other
extend widely said prince andrew angry snort when ridden past
extend father son sister bald hills
all same saying those german gentlemen won win battle tomorrow will only make all mess can nothing their german heads theories worth empty eggshell haven their hearts one thing needed tomorrow tim khin 
yielded all europe now come teach 
fine teachers again voice grew shrill
think shall win tomorrow battle asked pierre
yes yes answered prince andrew absently
one thing would power began again would take prisoners
why take prisoners chivalry french destroyed home are their way destroy moscow outraged are outraging every moment
thinks tim khin whole army
should executed since are foes cannot friends whatever may been said tilsit
yes yes muttered pierre looking shining eyes prince andrew
quite agree question perturbed pierre mozh ysk hill all day now seemed quite clear completely solved
now understood whole meaning importance war impending battle
all seen day all significant stern expressions faces seen passing lit new light
understood latent heat say physics patriotism present all men seen explained why all prepared death calmly lightheartedly
take prisoners prince andrew continued itself would quite change whole war make less cruel
played war vile play magnanimity all stuff
such magnanimity sensibility are like magnanimity sensibility lady faints when sees calf being killed kindhearted can look blood enjoys eating calf served sauce
talk rules war chivalry flags truce mercy unfortunate 
all rubbish saw chivalry flags truce 1805 humbugged humbugged 
plunder other people houses issue false paper money worst all kill children father talk rules war magnanimity foes take prisoners kill killed come through same sufferings
prince andrew thought all same whether moscow taken smol nsk been suddenly checked speech unexpected cramp throat
paced down few times silence eyes glittered feverishly lips quivered began speaking
there none magnanimity war should war only when worth going certain death now
there would war paul novichoffended michael novich
when there war like one would war determination troops would quite different
all westphalians hessians whom napoleon leading would follow into russia should fight austria prussia without knowing why
warcourtesy most horrible thing life ought understand play war
ought accept terrible necessity sternly seriously
all lies get rid falsehood let war war game
now war favorite pastime idle frivolous
military calling most highly honored
war needed success warfare are habits military aim war murder methods war are spying treachery their encouragement ruin country inhabitants robbing stealing provision army fraud falsehood termed military craft
habits military class are absence freedom discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery drunkenness
spite all highest class respected everyone
all kings except chinese wear military uniforms kills most people receives highest rewards
meet shall meet tomorrow murder one another kill maim tens thousands thanksgiving services having killed many people even exaggerate number announce victory supposing more people killed greater their achievement
does god above look hear exclaimed prince andrew shrill piercing voice
friend late become hard live
see begun understand much
doesn man taste tree knowledge good evil
well long added
however sleepy time sleep
back rki said prince andrew suddenly
pierre replied looking prince andrew frightened compassionate eyes
before battle one must one sleep out repeated prince andrew
came quickly pierre embraced kissed 
good off shouted
turning away hurriedly entered shed
already dark pierre could make out whether expression prince andrew face angry tender
time stood silence considering whether should follow away
does want pierre concluded
know our last meeting sighed deeply rode back rki
entering shed prince andrew lay down rug could sleep
closed eyes
one dwelt long joyfully
vividly recalled evening petersburg
nat sha animated excited face telling gone look mushrooms previous summer lost way big forest
incoherently described depths forest feelings talk beekeeper met constantly interrupted story saycan telling right don understand though encouraged saying did understand really understood all wanted say
nat sha satisfied own words felt did conveypassionately poetic feeling experienced day wished convey
such delightful old man dark forest
can describe said flushed excited
prince andrew smiled now same happy smile when looked into eyes
only understood just inner spiritual force sincerity frankness soul very soul hers seemed fettered body soul loved 
loved strongly happily
suddenly remembered love ended
neither saw nor understood anything sort
only saw pretty fresh young girl whom did deign unite fate
still alive gay prince andrew jumped someone burned again began pacing down front shed
august eve battle borodin 
beausset prefect french emperor palace arrived napoleon quarters val evo colonel fabvier former from paris latter from madrid
donning court uniform 
beausset ordered box brought emperor carried before entered first compartment napoleon tent where began opening box conversing napoleon aides camp surrounded 
fabvier entering tent remained entrance talking generals acquaintance
emperor napoleon yet left bedroom finishing toilet
slightly snorting grunting presented now back now plump hairy chest brush valet rubbing down
another valet finger over mouth bottle sprinkling eau cologne emperor pampered body expression seemed say alone knew where much eau cologne should sprinkled
napoleon short hair wet matted forehead face though puffy yellow expressed physical satisfaction
harder muttered valet rubbing slightly twitching grunting
aide camp entered bedroom report emperor number prisoners taken yesterday action standing door after delivering message awaiting permission withdraw
napoleon frowning looked from under brows
prisoners said repeating aide camp words
are forcing exterminate 
harder harder muttered hunching back presenting fat shoulders
all right
let monsieur beausset enter fabvier said nodding aide camp
yes sire aide camp disappeared through door tent
two valets rapidly dressed majesty wearing blue uniform guards went firm quick steps reception room
beausset hands meanwhile busily engaged arranging present brought from empress two chairs directly front entrance
napoleon dressed come out such unexpected rapidity time finish arranging surprise
napoleon noticed once about guessed ready
did wish deprive pleasure giving surprise pretended see beausset called fabvier listening silently stern frown fabvier told heroism devotion troops fighting salamanca other end europe one thought worthy their emperor one fear fail please 
result battle been deplorable
napoleon made ironic remarks during fabvier account expected matters could otherwise absence
must make moscow said napoleon
see later added summoned beausset time prepared surprise having placed something chairs covered cloth
beausset bowed low courtly french bow only old retainers bourbons knew make approached presenting envelope
napoleon turned gaily pulled ear
hurried 
well paris saying asked suddenly changing former stern expression most cordial tone
sire all paris regrets your absence replied beausset proper
though napoleon knew beausset say something kind though lucid moments knew untrue pleased hear from 
very sorry made travel far said 
sire expected nothing less than find gates moscow replied beausset
napoleon smiled lifting head absent mindedly glanced right
aide camp approached gliding steps offered gold snuffbox took
yes happened luckily said raising open snuffbox nose
are fond travel three days will see moscow
surely did expect see asiatic capital
will pleasant journey
beausset bowed gratefully regard taste travel till been aware 
asked napoleon noticing all courtiers looking something concealed under cloth
courtly adroitness beausset half turned without turning back emperor retired two steps twitching off cloth same time said present your majesty from empress
portrait painted bright colors rard son borne napoleon daughter emperor austria boy whom reason everyone called king rome
very pretty curly headed boy look christ sistine madonna depicted playing stick ball
ball represented terrestrial globe stick other hand scepter
though clear artist meant express depicting called king rome spiking earth stick allegory apparently seemed napoleon done all seen paris quite clear very pleasing
king rome said pointing portrait graceful gesture
admirable natural capacity italian changing expression face will drew nearer portrait assumed look pensive tenderness
felt now said did would historical seemed would now best whose grandeur enabled son play stick ball terrestrial globe show contrast grandeur simplest paternal tenderness
eyes grew dim moved forward glanced round chair seemed place itself under sat down before portrait
single gesture from everyone went out tiptoe leaving great man himself emotion
having sat still touched himself knowing why thick spot paint representing highest light portrait rose recalled beausset officer duty
ordered portrait carried outside tent old guard stationed round might deprived pleasure seeing king rome son heir their adored monarch
doing 
beausset honor breakfasting heard napoleon anticipated rapturous cries officers men old guard run see portrait
vive empereur vive roi rome vive empereur came those ecstatic cries
after breakfast napoleon beausset presence dictated order day army
short energetic remarked when read over proclamation dictated straight off without corrections
ran soldiers battle longed 
victory depends 
essential will give all need comfortable quarters speedy return our country
behave did austerlitz friedland tebsk smol nsk
let our remotest posterity recall your achievements day pride
let said each great battle before moscow before moscow repeated napoleon inviting 
beausset fond travel accompany ride went out tent where horses stood saddled
your majesty kind replied beausset invitation accompany emperor wanted sleep did know ride afraid doing 
napoleon nodded traveler beausset mount
when napoleon came out tent shouting guards before son portrait grew still louder
take away said pointing gracefully majestic gesture portrait
soon see field battle
beausset closed eyes bowed head sighed deeply indicate profoundly valued comprehended emperor words
twenty fifth august historians tell napoleon spent whole day horseback inspecting locality considering plans submitted marshals personally giving commands generals
original line russian forces along river koloch been dislocated capture shev rdino redoubt twenty fourth part line left flank been drawn back
part line entrenched front ground more open level than elsewhere
evident anyone military french should attack
would seem much consideration needed reach conclusion nor particular care trouble part emperor marshals nor there need special supreme quality called genius people are apt ascribe napoleon yet historians described event later men surrounded napoleon himself thought otherwise
napoleon rode over plain surveyed locality profound air silence nodded approval shook head dubiously without communicating generals around profound course ideas guided decisions merely gave final conclusions form commands
having listened suggestion from davout now called prince eckm turn russian left wing napoleon said should done without explaining why 
proposal made general campan attack ches lead divisionthrough woods napoleon agreed though called duke elchingen ney ventured remark movement through woods dangerous might disorder division
having inspected country opposite shev rdino redoubt napoleon pondered little silence indicated spots where two batteries should set morrow act against russian entrenchments places where line field artillery should placed
after giving other commands returned tent dispositions battle written down from dictation
dispositions french historians write enthusiasm other historians profound respect follows dawn two new batteries established during night plain occupied prince eckm will open fire opposing batteries enemy
same time commander artillery 1st corps general pernetti thirty cannon campan division all howitzers dessaix friant divisions will move forward open fire overwhelm shellfire enemy battery against will operate commander artillery 3rd corps general fouch will place howitzers 3rd 8th corps sixteen all flanks battery bombard entrenchment left will forty guns all directed against 
general sorbier must ready first order advance all howitzers guard artillery against either one other entrenchments
during cannonade prince poniatowski advance through wood village turn enemy position
general campan will move through wood seize first fortification
after advance begun manner orders will given accordance enemy movements
cannonade left flank will begin soon guns right wing are heard
sharpshooters morand division vice king division will open heavy fire seeing attack commence right wing
vice king will occupy village cross three bridges advancing same heights morand gibrard divisions under leadership will directed against redoubt come into line rest forces
all must done good order tout fera avec ordre thode far possible retaining troops reserve
imperial camp near mozh ysk september 1812
dispositions are very obscure confused one allows oneself regard arrangements without religious awe genius related napoleon ordersdeal four points four different orders
one could carried out
disposition said first batteries placed spot chosen napoleon guns pernetti fouch come line 102 guns all open fire shower shells russian ches redoubts
could done from spots selected napoleon projectiles did carry russian works those 102 guns shot into air until nearest commander contrary napoleon instructions moved forward
second order poniatowski moving village through wood should turn russian left flank
could done done poniatowski advancing village through wood met chkov there barring way could did turn russian position
third order general campan will move through wood seize first fortification
general campan division did seize first fortification driven back emerging from wood reform under grapeshot napoleon unaware
fourth order vice king will occupy village borodin cross three bridges advancing same heights morand rard divisions whose movements directions are given under leadership will directed against redoubt come into line rest forces
far one can make out much from unintelligible sentence from attempts vice king made execute orders given advance from left through borodin redoubt divisions morand rard advance simultaneously from front
all like other parts disposition could executed
after passing through borodin vice king driven back koloch could get farther divisions morand rard did take redoubt driven back redoubt only taken end battle cavalry thing probably unforeseen heard napoleon 
one orders disposition could executed
disposition said after fight commenced manner orders will given accordance enemy movements might supposed all necessary arrangements would made napoleon during battle
could done during whole battle napoleon far away appeared later could know course battle one orders during fight could executed
many historians say french did win battle borodin napoleon cold cold orders gave before during battle would been still more full genius russia would been lost face world been changed
historians believe russia shaped will one man peter great france from republic became empire french armies went russia will one man napoleon say russia remained power napoleon bad cold twenty fourth august may seem logical convincing
depended napoleon will fight fight battle borodin other arrangement depended will evidently cold affecting manifestation will might saved russiaconsequently valet omitted bring napoleon waterproof boots twenty fourth would been savior russia
along line thought such deduction indubitable indubitable deduction voltaire made jest without knowing jesting when saw massacre 
bartholomew due charles stomach being deranged
men admit russia formed will one man peter french empire formed war russia begun will one man napoleon argument seems merely untrue irrational contrary all human reality
question causes historic events another answer presents itself namely course human events predetermined from high depends coincidence wills all take part events napoleon influence course events purely external fictitious
strange first glance may seem suppose massacre 
bartholomew due charles will though gave order thought done result order strange may seem suppose slaughter eighty thousand men borodin due napoleon will though ordered commencement conduct battle thought done ordered strange suppositions appear yet human dignity tells each more least less man than great napoleon demands acceptance solution question historic investigation abundantly confirms 
battle borodin napoleon shot onekilled one
all done soldiers
french soldiers went kill killed battle borodin napoleon orders their own volition
whole army french italian german polish dutch hungry ragged weary campaign felt sight army blocking their road moscow wine drawn must drunk
napoleon forbidden fight russians would killed proceeded fight russians inevitable
when heard napoleon proclamation offering compensation mutilation death words posterity about their having been battle before moscow cried vive empereur just cried vive empereur sight portrait boy piercing terrestrial globe toy stick just would cried vive empereur nonsense might told 
there nothing left cry vive empereur fight order get food rest conquerors moscow
napoleon commands killed their fellow men
napoleon directed course battle none orders executed during battle did know going before 
way people killed one another decided napoleon will occurred independently accord will hundreds thousands people took part common action
only seemed napoleon all took place will
question whether cold more historic interest than cold least transport soldiers
moreover assertion made various writers cold cause dispositions being well planned former occasions orders during battle being good previously quite baseless again shows napoleon cold twenty sixth august unimportant
dispositions cited above are all worse are even better than previous dispositions won victories
pseudo orders during battle also worse than formerly much same usual
dispositions orders only seem worse than previous ones battle borodin first napoleon did win
profoundest most excellent dispositions orders seem very bad every learned militarist criticizes looks importance when relate battle been lost very worst dispositions orders seem very good serious people fill whole volumes demonstrate their merits when relate battle been won
dispositions drawn weyrother battle austerlitz model perfection kind composition still criticized criticized their very perfection their excessive minuteness
napoleon battle borodin fulfilled office representative authority well even better than other battles
did nothing harmful progress battle inclined most reasonable opinions made confusion did contradict himself did get frightened run away from field battle great tact military experience carried out role appearing command calmly dignity
returning from second inspection lines napoleon remarked chessmen are set game will begin tomorrow having ordered punch summoned beausset began talk about paris about changes meant make empress household surprising prefect memory minute details relating court
showed interest trifles joked about beausset love travel chatted carelessly famous self confident surgeon knows job does when turning sleeves putting apron patient being strapped operating table
matter hands clear definite head
when time comes set work shall one else could now can jest more jest calmer more tranquil confident ought more amazed genius
having finished second glass punch napoleon went rest before serious business considered awaited next day
much interested task unable sleep spite cold grown worse from dampness evening went into large division tent three clock morning loudly blowing nose
asked whether russians withdrawn told enemy fires still same places
adjutant attendance came into tent
well rapp think shall good business today napoleon asked 
without doubt sire replied rapp
napoleon looked 
remember sire did honor say smol nsk continued rapp
napoleon frowned sat silent long time leaning head hand
poor army suddenly remarked
diminished greatly since smol nsk
always said beginning experience 
guards rapp guards are intact remarked interrogatively
yes sire replied rapp
napoleon took lozenge put mouth glanced watch
sleepy still nearly morning
impossible give further orders sake killing time orders all been given now being executed

art being stronger than enemy given moment
rapp made reply

did feel sleepy
punch finished there still nothing 
rose walked fro put warm overcoat hat went out tent
night dark damp scarcely perceptible moisture descending from above
near campfires dimly burning among french guards distance those russian line shone through smoke
weather calm rustle tramp french troops already beginning move take their positions clearly audible
napoleon walked about front tent looked fires listened sounds passing tall guardsman shaggy cap standing sentinel before tent drawn himself like black pillar sight emperor napoleon stopped front 
year did enter service asked affectation military bluntness geniality always addressed soldiers
man answered question
one old ones your regiment rice your majesty
napoleon nodded walked away
half past five napoleon rode village shev rdino
growing light sky clearing only single cloud lay east
abandoned campfires burning themselves out faint morning light
right single deep report cannon resounded died away prevailing silence
second third report shook air fourth fifth boomed solemnly near right
first shots yet ceased reverberate before others rang out yet more heard mingling overtaking one another
napoleon suite rode shev rdino redoubt where dismounted
returning rki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered groom get horses ready call early morning immediately fell asleep behind partition corner bor given 
before thoroughly awake next morning everybody already left hut
panes rattling little windows groom shaking 
your excellency your excellency your excellency kept repeating pertinaciously shook pierre shoulder without looking having apparently lost hope getting wake 
begun time pierre asked waking 
hear firing said groom discharged soldier
all gentlemen gone out serene highness himself rode past long ago
pierre dressed hastily ran out porch
outside all bright fresh dewy cheerful
sun just bursting forth from behind cloud concealed shining rays still half broken clouds over roofs street opposite dew besprinkled dust road walls houses windows fence pierre horses standing before hut
roar guns sounded more distinct outside
adjutant accompanied cossack passed sharp trot
time count time cried adjutant
telling groom follow horses pierre went down street knoll from looked field battle day before
crowd military men assembled there members staff could heard conversing french kut zov gray head white cap red band visible gray nape sunk between shoulders
looking through field glass down highroad before 
mounting steps knoll pierre looked scene before spellbound beauty
same panorama admired from spot day before now whole place full troops covered smoke clouds from guns slanting rays bright sun rising slightly left behind pierre cast upon through clear morning air penetrating streaks rosy golden tinted light long dark shadows
forest farthest extremity panorama seemed carved precious stone yellowish green color undulating outline silhouetted against horizon pierced beyond val evo smol nsk highroad crowded troops
nearer hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed copses
there troops seen everywhere front right left
all vivid majestic unexpected impressed pierre most all view battlefield itself borodin hollows both sides koloch 
above koloch borodin both sides especially left where yna flowing between marshy banks falls into koloch mist spread seemed melt dissolve become translucent when brilliant sun appeared magically colored outlined everything
smoke guns mingled mist over whole expanse through mist rays morning sun reflected flashing back like lightning from water from dew from bayonets troops crowded together riverbanks borodin 
white church could seen through mist there roofs huts borodin well dense masses soldiers green ammunition chests ordnance
all moved seemed move smoke mist spread out over whole space
just mist enveloped hollow near borodin along entire line outside above especially woods fields left valleys summits high ground clouds powder smoke seemed continually spring out nothing now singly now several time translucent others dense swelling growing rolling blending extended over whole expanse
puffs smoke strange say sound firing produced chief beauty spectacle
puff suddenly round compact cloud smoke seen merging from violet into gray milky white boom came report second later
puff puff two clouds arose pushing one another blending together boom boom came sounds confirming eye seen
pierre glanced round first cloud seen round compact ball place already balloons smoke floating one side puff pause puff puff three four more appeared from each same interval boom boom boom came fine firm precise sounds reply
seemed those smoke clouds sometimes ran sometimes stood still woods fields glittering bayonets ran past 
from left over fields bushes those large balls smoke continually appearing followed their solemn reports nearer still hollows woods there burst from muskets small cloudlets time become balls their little echoes just same way
trakh takh came frequent crackle musketry irregular feeble comparison reports cannon
pierre wished there smoke those shining bayonets movement those sounds
turned look kut zov suite compare impressions those others
all looking field battle seemed same feelings
all their faces now shining latent warmth feeling pierre noticed day before fully understood after talk prince andrew
dear fellow 
christ kut zov saying general stood beside taking eye from battlefield
having received order general passed pierre way down knoll
crossing said general coldly sternly reply one staff asked where going
there thought pierre followed general
general mounted horse cossack brought 
pierre went groom holding horses asking quietest clambered onto seized mane turning out toes pressed heels against sides feeling spectacles slipping off unable let mane reins galloped after general causing staff officers smile watched from knoll
having descended hill general after whom pierre galloping turned sharply left pierre losing sight galloped among ranks infantry marching ahead 
tried pass either front right left there soldiers everywhere all same preoccupied expression busy unseen evidently important task
all gazed same dissatisfied inquiring expression stout man white hat unknown reason threatened trample under horse hoofs
why ride into middle battalion one shouted 
another prodded horse butt end musket pierre bending over saddlebow hardly able control shying horse galloped ahead soldiers where there free space
there bridge ahead where other soldiers stood firing
pierre rode 
without being aware come bridge across koloch between rki borodin french having occupied borodin attacking first phase battle
pierre saw there bridge front soldiers doing something both sides meadow among rows new mown hay taken notice amid smoke campfires day before despite incessant firing going there idea field battle
did notice sound bullets whistling from every side projectiles flew over did see enemy other side river long time did notice killed wounded though many fell near 
looked about smile did leave face
why fellow front line shouted somebody again

keep right men shouted 
pierre went right unexpectedly encountered one vski adjutants whom knew
adjutant looked angrily evidently also intending shout recognizing nodded
got said galloped 
pierre feeling out place there having nothing afraid getting someone way again galloped after adjutant
happening may come asked
one moment one moment replied adjutant riding stout colonel standing meadow gave message addressed pierre
why come count asked smile
still inquisitive yes yes assented pierre
adjutant turned horse about rode 
tolerable said bagrati left flank getting frightfully hot
really said pierre

only now noticed wounded men staggering along being carried stretchers
very meadow ridden over day before soldier lying athwart rows scented hay head thrown awkwardly back shako off
why haven carried away pierre about ask seeing stern expression adjutant also looking way checked himself
pierre did find groom rode along hollow adjutant vski redoubt
horse lagged behind adjutant jolted every step
don seem used riding count remarked adjutant
action seems jerky said pierre puzzled tone
why
off foreleg above knee
congratulate count your baptism fire having ridden smoke past sixth corps behind artillery been moved forward action deafening noise firing came small wood
there cool quiet scent autumn
pierre adjutant dismounted walked hill foot
general asked adjutant reaching knoll
minute ago just gone way someone told pointing right
adjutant looked pierre puzzled now
don trouble about said pierre
onto knoll may yes 
see everything from there less dangerous come 
pierre went battery adjutant rode 
did meet again only much later did pierre learn lost arm day
knoll pierre ascended famous one afterwards known russians knoll battery vski redoubt french grande redoute fatale redoute redoute centre around tens thousands fell french regarded key whole position
redoubt consisted knoll three sides trenches been dug
within entrenchment stood ten guns being fired through openings earthwork
line knoll both sides stood other guns also fired incessantly
when ascending knoll pierre notion spot small trenches been dug from few guns firing most important point battle
contrary just happened there thought one least significant parts field
having reached knoll pierre sat down one end trench surrounding battery gazed going around unconsciously happy smile
occasionally rose walked about battery still same smile trying obstruct soldiers loading hauling guns continually running past bags charges
guns battery being fired continually one after another deafening roar enveloping whole neighborhood powder smoke
contrast dread felt infantrymen placed support battery where small number men busy their work separated from rest trench everyone experienced common family feeling animation
intrusion pierre nonmilitary figure white hat made unpleasant impression first
soldiers looked askance surprise even alarm went past 
senior artillery officer tall long legged pockmarked man moved over pierre see action farthest gun looked curiosity
young round faced officer quite boy still evidently only just out cadet college zealously commanding two guns entrusted addressed pierre sternly
sir said permit ask stand aside
must 
soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly looked pierre
when convinced themselves man white hat doing harm either sat quietly slope trench shy smile politely making way soldiers paced down battery under fire calmly boulevard their feeling hostile distrust gradually began change into kindly bantering sympathy such soldiers feel their dogs cocks goats general animals live regiment
men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted gave nickname our gentleman made kindly fun among themselves
shell tore earth two paces from pierre looked around smile brushed from clothes earth thrown 
afraid sir really now red faced broad shouldered soldier asked pierre grin disclosed set sound white teeth
are afraid said pierre
else expect answered soldier
mercy know when comes spluttering down out your innards
one can help being afraid said laughing
several men bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre
seemed expected talk like anybody else discovery did delighted 
business soldiers
gentleman wonderful there gentleman your places cried young officer men gathered round pierre
young officer evidently exercising duties first second time therefore treated both superiors men great precision formality
booming cannonade fusillade musketry growing more intense over whole field especially left where bagrati ches where pierre smoke firing made almost impossible distinguish anything
moreover whole attention engrossed watching family circle separated from all else formed men battery
first unconscious feeling joyful animation produced sights sounds battlefield now replaced another especially since seen soldier lying alone hayfield
now seated slope trench observed faces those around 
ten clock twenty men already been carried away from battery two guns smashed cannon balls fell more more frequently battery spent bullets buzzed whistled around
men battery seemed notice merry voices jokes heard all sides
live one shouted man whistling shell approached
way infantry added another loud laughter seeing shell fly past fall into ranks supports
are bowing friend remarked another chaffing peasant ducked low cannon ball flew over
several soldiers gathered wall trench looking out see happening front
withdrawn front line retired said pointing over earthwork
mind your own business old sergeant shouted 
retired there work farther back
sergeant taking one men shoulders gave shove knee
fifth gun wheel came shouts from one side
now all together like bargees rose merry voices those moving gun
nearly knocked our gentleman hat off cried red faced humorist showing teeth chaffing pierre
awkward baggage added reproachfully cannon ball struck cannon wheel man leg
now foxes said another laughing militiamen stooping low entered battery carry away wounded man
gruel isn your taste crows scared shouted militiamen stood hesitating before man whose leg been torn off
there lads
mimicked peasants don like all pierre noticed after every ball hit redoubt after every loss liveliness increased moremore
flames fire hidden within come more more vividly rapidly from approaching thundercloud opposition taking place lightning hidden fire growing more more intense glowed faces men
pierre did look out battlefield concerned know happening there entirely absorbed watching fire burned ever more brightly felt flaming same way own soul
ten clock infantry been among bushes front battery along menka streamlet retreated
from battery could seen running back past carrying their wounded their muskets
general suite came battery after speaking colonel gave pierre angry look went away again having ordered infantry supports behind battery lie down less exposed fire
after from amid ranks infantry right battery came sound drum shouts command from battery one saw those ranks infantry moved forward
pierre looked over wall trench particularly struck pale young officer letting sword hang down walking backwards kept glancing uneasily around
ranks infantry disappeared amid smoke their long drawn shout rapid musketry firing could still heard
few minutes later crowds wounded men stretcher bearers came back from direction
projectiles began fall still more frequently battery
several men lying about been removed
around cannon men moved still more briskly busily
one longer took notice pierre
once twice shouted being way
senior officer moved big rapid strides from one gun another frowning face
young officer face still more flushed commanded men more scrupulously than ever
soldiers handed charges turned loaded did their business strained smartness
gave little jumps walked though springs
stormcloud come upon every face fire pierre watched kindle burned brightly
pierre standing beside commanding officer
young officer hand shako ran superior
honor report sir only eight rounds are left
are continue firing asked
grapeshot senior shouted without answering question looking over wall trench
suddenly something happened young officer gave gasp bending double sat down ground like bird shot wing
everything became strange confused misty pierre eyes
one cannon ball after another whistled struck earthwork soldier gun
pierre noticed sounds before now heard nothing else
right battery soldiers shouting hurrah running forwards backwards seemed pierre
cannon ball struck very end earth work standing crumbling down earth black ball flashed before eyes same instant plumped into something
militiamen entering battery ran back
all grapeshot shouted officer
sergeant ran officer frightened whisper informed butler dinner informs master there more wine asked there more charges
scoundrels are doing shouted officer turning pierre
officer face red perspiring eyes glittered under frowning brow
run reserves bring ammunition boxes yelled angrily avoiding pierre eyes speaking men
said pierre
officer without answering strode across opposite side
don fire
man been ordered ammunition stumbled against pierre
sir place said ran down slope
pierre ran after avoiding spot where young officer sitting
one cannon ball another third flew over falling front beside behind 
where going suddenly asked himself when already near green ammunition wagons
halted irresolutely knowing whether return 
suddenly terrible concussion threw backwards ground
same instant dazzled great flash flame immediately deafening roar crackling whistling made ears tingle
when came himself sitting ground leaning hands ammunition wagons been approaching longer existed only charred green boards rags littered scorched grass horse dangling fragments shaft behind galloped past another horse lay like pierre ground uttering prolonged piercing cries
beside himself terror pierre jumped ran back battery only refuge from horrors surrounded 
entering earthwork noticed there men doing something there shots being fired from battery
time realize men 
saw senior officer lying earth wall back turned examining something down below one soldiers noticed before struggling forward shouting brothers trying free himself from men holding arm
time realize colonel been killed soldier shouting brothers prisoner another man been bayoneted back before eyes hardly run into redoubt before thin sallow faced perspiring man blue uniform rushed sword hand shouting something
instinctively guarding against shock been running together full speed before saw one another pierre put out hands seized man french officer shoulder one hand throat other
officer dropping sword seized pierre collar
seconds gazed frightened eyes one another unfamiliar faces both perplexed done next
taken prisoner taken prisoner each thinking
french officer evidently more inclined think been taken prisoner pierre strong hand impelled instinctive fear squeezed throat ever tightertighter
frenchman about say something when just above their heads terrible low cannon ball whistled seemed pierre french officer head been torn off swiftly ducked 
pierre bent head let hands fall
without further thought taken whom prisoner frenchman ran back battery pierre ran down slope stumbling over dead wounded seemed caught feet
before reached foot knoll met dense crowd russian soldiers stumbling tripping shouting ran merrily wildly toward battery
attack erm lov claimed credit declaring only courage good luck made such feat possible attack said thrown 
george crosses pocket into battery first soldiers take got there
french occupied battery fled our troops shouting hurrah pursued far beyond battery difficult call back
prisoners brought down from battery among wounded french general whom officers surrounded
crowds wounded known pierre unknown russians french faces distorted suffering walked crawled carried stretchers from battery
pierre again went onto knoll where spent over hour family circle received member did find single one
there many dead whom did know recognized
young officer still sat same way bent double pool blood edge earth wall
red faced man still twitching did carry away
pierre ran down slope once more
now will stop now will horrified done thought aimlessly going toward crowd stretcher bearers moving from battlefield
behind veil smoke sun still high front especially left near sem novsk something seemed seething smoke roar cannon musketry did diminish even increased desperation like man straining himself shrieks all remaining strength
chief action battle borodin fought within seven thousand feet between borodin bagrati ches
beyond space there one side demonstration made russians rov cavalry midday other side beyond tsa poniatowski collision chkov two detached feeble actions comparison took place center battlefield
field between borodin ches beside wood chief action day took place open space visible from both sides fought simplest most artless way
battle began both sides cannonade from several hundred guns
when whole field covered smoke two divisions campan dessaix advanced from french right murat troops advanced borodin from their left
from shev rdino redoubt where napoleon standing ches two thirds mile away more than mile crow flies borodin napoleon could see happening there especially smoke mingling mist hid whole locality
soldiers dessaix division advancing against chescould only seen till entered hollow lay between ches
soon descended into hollow smoke guns musketry ches grew dense covered whole approach side 
through smoke glimpses could caught something black probably men times glint bayonets
whether moving stationary whether french russian could discovered from shev rdino redoubt
sun risen brightly slanting rays struck straight into napoleon face shading eyes hand looked ches
smoke spread out before times looked smoke moving times troops moved
sometimes shouts heard through firing impossible tell being done there
napoleon standing knoll looked through field glass small circlet saw smoke men sometimes own sometimes russians when looked again naked eye could tell where seen 
descended knoll began walking down before 
occasionally stopped listened firing gazed intently battlefield
only impossible make out happening from where standing down below from knoll above generals taken their stand even from ches themselves time there now russian now french soldiers alternately together dead wounded alive frightened maddened even those ches themselves impossible make out taking place
there several hours amid incessant cannon musketry fire now russians seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantry now cavalry appeared fired fell collided knowing one another screamed ran back again
from battlefield adjutants sent out orderlies from marshals kept galloping napoleon reports progress action all reports falseboth impossible heat battle say happening given moment many adjutants did actual place conflict reported heard from others also adjutant riding more than mile napoleon circumstances changed news brought already becoming false
thus adjutant galloped from murat tidings borodin been occupied bridge over koloch hands french
adjutant asked whether napoleon wished troops cross napoleon gave orders troops should form farther side wait
before order given almost soon fact adjutant left borodin bridge been retaken russians burned very skirmish pierre been present beginning battle
adjutant galloped from ches pale frightened face reported napoleon their attack been repulsed campan wounded davout killed yet very time adjutant been told french been repulsed ches fact been recaptured other french troops davout alive only slightly bruised
basis necessarily untrustworthy reports napoleon gave orders either been executedbefore gave could executed
marshals generals nearer field battle like napoleon did take part actual fighting only occasionally went within musket range made their own arrangements without asking napoleon issued orders where direction fire where cavalry should gallop infantry should run
even their orders like napoleon seldom carried out partially
most part things happened contrary their orders
soldiers ordered advance ran back meeting grapeshot soldiers ordered remain where suddenly seeing russiansunexpectedly before sometimes rushed back sometimes forward cavalry dashed without orders pursuit flying russians
way two cavalry regiments galloped through sem novsk hollow soon reached top incline turned round galloped full speed back again
infantry moved same way sometimes running quite other places than those ordered 
all orders where when move guns when send infantry shoot horsemen ride down russian infantry all such orders given officers spot nearest units concerned without asking either ney davout murat much less napoleon
did fear getting into trouble fulfilling orders acting their own initiative battle stake dearest man own life sometimes seems safety lies running back sometimes running forward men right heat battle acted according mood moment
reality however all movements forward backward did improve alter position troops
all their rushing galloping one another did little harm harm disablement death caused balls bullets flew over fields men floundering about
soon left place where balls bullets flying about their superiors located background formed brought under discipline under influence discipline led back zone fire where under influence fear death lost their discipline rushed about according chance promptings throng
napoleon generals davout ney murat near region fire sometimes even entered repeatedly led into huge masses well ordered troops
contrary always happened their former battles instead news expected enemy flight orderly masses returned thence disorganized terrified mobs
generals formed their numbers constantly decreased
middle day murat sent adjutant napoleon demand reinforcements
napoleon sat foot knoll drinking punch when murat adjutant galloped assurance russians would routed majesty would let another division
reinforcements said napoleon tone stern surprise looking adjutant handsome lad long black curls arranged like murat own though did understand words
reinforcements thought napoleon himself
can need reinforcements when already half army directed against weak unentrenched russian wing tell king naples said sternly noon yet don yet see chessboard clearly
handsome boy adjutant long hair sighed deeply without removing hand from hat galloped back where men being slaughtered
napoleon rose having summoned caulaincourt berthier began talking about matters unconnected battle
midst conversation beginning interest napoleon berthier eyes turned look general suite galloping toward knoll lathering horse
having dismounted went emperor rapid strides loud voice began boldly demonstrating necessity sending reinforcements
swore honor russians lost emperor would give another division
napoleon shrugged shoulders continued pace down without replying
belliard began talking loudly eagerly generals suite around 
are very fiery belliard said napoleon when again came general
heat battle easy make mistake
another look come back 
before belliard out sight messenger from another part battlefield galloped 
now want asked napoleon tone man irritated being continually disturbed
sire prince
asks reinforcements said napoleon angry gesture
adjutant bent head affirmatively began report emperor turned from took couple steps stopped came back called berthier
must give reserves said moving arms slightly apart
think should sent there asked berthier whom subsequently termed gosling made eagle 
send clapar division sire replied berthier knew all division regiments battalions heart
napoleon nodded assent
adjutant galloped clapar division few minutes later young guards stationed behind knoll moved forward
napoleon gazed silently direction
suddenly said berthier
send friant division
though there advantage sending friant division instead clapar even obvious inconvenience delay stopping clapar sending friant now order carried out exactly
napoleon did notice regard army playing part doctor hinders medicines role justly understood condemned
friant division disappeared others done into smoke battlefield
from all sides adjutants continued arrive gallop agreement all said same thing
all asked reinforcements all said russians holding their positions maintaining hellish fire under french army melting away
napoleon sat campstool wrapped thought

beausset man fond travel having fasted since morning came emperor ventured respectfully suggest lunch majesty
hope may now congratulate your majesty victory said 
napoleon silently shook head negation
assuming negation refer only victory lunch 
beausset ventured respectful jocularity remark there reason having lunch when one can get 
away
exclaimed napoleon suddenly morosely turned aside
beatific smile regret repentance ecstasy beamed 
beausset face glided away other generals
napoleon experiencing feeling depression like ever lucky gambler after recklessly flinging money about always winning suddenly just when calculated all chances game finds more considers play more surely loses
troops same generals same same preparations been made same dispositions same proclamation courte nergique himself still same knew knew now even more experienced skillful than before
even enemy same austerlitz friedland yet terrible stroke arm supernaturally become impotent
all old methods been unfailingly crowned success concentration batteries one point attack reserves break enemy line cavalry attack men iron all methods already been employed yet only there victory from all sides came same news generals killed wounded reinforcements needed impossibility driving back russians disorganization among own troops
formerly after given two three orders uttered few phrases marshals adjutants come galloping congratulations happy faces announcing trophies taken corps prisoners bundles enemy eagles standards cannon stores murat only begged leave loose cavalry gather baggage wagons
been lodi marengo arcola jena austerlitz wagram 
now something strange happening troops
despite news capture ches napoleon saw same all same happened former battles
saw feeling felt all men about experienced art war
all their faces looked dejected all shunned one another eyes only beausset could fail grasp meaning happening
napoleon long experience war well knew meaning battle gained attacking side eight hours after all efforts been expended
knew lost battle least accident might now fight balanced such strained center destroy army
when ran mindover whole strange russian campaign one battle been won flag cannon army corps been captured two months when looked concealed depression faces around heard reports russians still holding their ground terrible feeling like nightmare took possession all unlucky accidents might destroy occurred mind
russians might fall left wing might break through center himself might killed stray cannon ball
former battles only considered possibilities success now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves expected all
yes like dream man fancies ruffian coming attack raises arm strike ruffian terrible blow knows should annihilate feels arm drops powerless limp like rag horror unavoidable destruction seizes helplessness
news russians attacking left flank french army aroused horror napoleon
sat silently campstool below knoll head bowed elbows knees
berthier approached suggested should ride along line ascertain position affairs
say asked napoleon
yes tell bring horse
mounted rode toward sem novsk
amid powder smoke slowly dispersing over whole space through napoleon rode horses men lying pools blood singly heaps
neither napoleon nor generals ever before seen such horrors many slain such small area
roar guns ceased ten hours wearied ear gave peculiar significance spectacle music does tableaux vivants
napoleon rode high ground sem novsk through smoke saw ranks men uniforms color unfamiliar 
russians stood serried ranks behind sem novsk village knoll their guns boomed incessantly along their line sent forth clouds smoke
longer battle continuous slaughter could avail either french russians
napoleon stopped horse again fell into reverie from berthier aroused 
could stop going before around supposed directed depend from lack success affair first time seemed unnecessary horrible
one generals rode napoleon ventured offer lead old guard into action
ney berthier standing near napoleon exchanged looks smiled contemptuously general senseless offer
napoleon bowed head remained silent long time
eight hundred leagues from france will guard destroyed said turning horse rode back shev rdino
rug covered bench where pierre seen morning sat kut zov gray head hanging heavy body relaxed
gave orders only assented dissented from others suggested
yes yes replied various proposals
yes yes dear boy look would say one another those about don better wait listened reports brought gave directions when subordinates demanded when listening reports seemed interested import words spoken rather something else expression face tone voice those reporting
long years military experience knew wisdom age understood impossible one man direct hundreds thousands others struggling death knew result battle decided orders commander chief nor place where troops are stationed nor number cannon slaughtered men intangible force called spirit army watched force guided far power
kut zov general expression one concentrated quiet attention face wore strained look found difficult master fatigue old feeble body
eleven clock brought news ches captured french been retaken prince bagrati wounded
kut zov groaned swayed head
ride over prince peter novich find out about exactly said one adjutants turned duke rttemberg standing behind 
will your highness please take command first army soon after duke departure before could possibly reached sem novsk adjutant came back from told kut zov duke asked more troops
kut zov made grimace sent order dokht rov take over command first army request duke whom said could spare such important moment return 
when brought news murat been taken prisoner staff officers congratulated kut zov smiled
wait little gentlemen said 
battle won there nothing extraordinary capture murat
still better wait before rejoice
sent adjutant take news round army
when scherb nin came galloping from left flank news french captured ches village sem novsk kut zov guessing sounds battle scherb nin looks news bad rose stretch legs taking scherb nin arm led aside
dear fellow said erm lov see whether something can done
kut zov rki near center russian position
attack directed napoleon against our left flank been several times repulsed
center french got beyond borodin their left flank rov cavalry put french flight
toward three clock french attacks ceased
faces all came from field battle those stood around kut zov noticed expression extreme tension
satisfied day success success exceeding expectations old man strength failing 
several times head dropped low falling dozed off
adjutant general wolzogen man when riding past prince andrew said war should extended widely whom bagrati detested rode kut zov dinner
wolzogen come from barclay tolly report progress affairs left flank
sagacious barclay tolly seeing crowds wounded men running back disordered rear army weighed all circumstances concluded battle lost sent favorite officer commander chief news
kut zov chewing piece roast chicken difficulty glanced wolzogen eyes brightened under their puckering lids
wolzogen nonchalantly stretching legs approached kut zov half contemptuous smile lips scarcely touching peak cap
treated serene highness somewhat affected nonchalance intended show highly trained military man left russians make idol useless old man knew whom dealing 
der alte herr their own set germans called kut zov making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen looking severely dishes front kut zov began report old gentleman position affairs left flank barclay ordered himself seen understood 
all points our position are enemy hands cannot dislodge lack troops men are running away impossible stop reported
kut zov ceased chewing fixed astonished gaze wolzogen understanding said 
wolzogen noticing old gentleman agitation said smile considered right conceal from your serene highness seen

frowning rising quickly went wolzogen

shouted choking making threatening gesture trembling arms dare sir say know nothing about 
tell general barclay from information incorrect real course battle better known commander chief than 
wolzogen about make rejoinder kut zov interrupted 
enemy been repulsed left defeated right flank
seen amiss sir allow yourself say don know good ride general barclay inform firm intention attack enemy tomorrow said kut zov sternly
all silent only sound audible heavy breathing panting old general
are repulsed everywhere thank god our brave army enemy beaten tomorrow shall drive from sacred soil russia said kut zov crossing himself suddenly sobbed eyes filled tears
wolzogen shrugging shoulders curling lips stepped silently aside marveling old gentleman conceited stupidity
hero said kut zov portly handsome dark haired general just ascending knoll
vski spent whole day most important part field borodin 
vski reported troops firmly holding their ground french longer ventured attack
after hearing kut zov said french think like others must retreat contrary your highness indecisive actions always most stubborn remain victors replied vski opinion
kays rov kut zov called adjutant
sit down write out order day tomorrow
continued addressing another ride along line announce tomorrow attack
kut zov talking vski dictating order day wolzogen returned from barclay said general barclay wished written confirmation order field marshal given
kut zov without looking wolzogen gave directions order written out former commander chief avoid personal responsibility very judiciously wished receive
means mysterious indefinable bond maintains throughout army one same temper known spirit army constitutes sinew war kut zov words order battle next day immediately became known from one end army other
far from being same words same order reached farthest links chain
tales passing from mouth mouth different ends army did even resemble kut zov said sense words spread everywhere said outcome cunning calculations feeling lay commander chief soul every russian
learning tomorrow attack enemy hearing from highest quarters confirmation wanted believe exhausted wavering men felt comforted inspirited
prince andrew regiment among reserves till after one clock stationed inactive behind sem novsk under heavy artillery fire
toward two clockregiment having already lost more than two hundred men moved forward into trampled oatfield gap between sem novsk knoll battery where thousands men perished day intense concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns directed between one two clock
without moving from spot firing single shot regiment lost another third men
from front especially from right unlifting smoke guns boomed out mysterious domain smoke overlay whole space front quick hissing cannon balls slow whistling shells flew unceasingly
times allow respite quarter hour passed during cannon balls shells all flew overhead sometimes several men torn from regiment minute slain continually being dragged away wounded carried off
each fresh blow less less chance life remained those yet killed
regiment stood columns battalion three hundred paces apart nevertheless men always one same mood
talk rarely heardranks ceased altogether every time thud successful shot cry stretchers heard
most time their officers order men sat ground
one having taken off shako carefully loosened gathers lining drew tight againanother rubbing dry clay between palms polished bayonet another fingered strap pulled buckle bandolier another smoothed refolded leg bands put boots again
built little houses tufts plowed ground plaited baskets from straw cornfield
all seemed fully absorbed pursuits
when men killed wounded when rows stretchers went past when troops retreated when great masses enemy came into view through smoke one paid attention things
when our artillery cavalry advanced our infantry seen move forward words approval heard all sides
liveliest attention attracted occurrences quite apart from unconnected battle
minds morally exhausted men found relief everyday commonplace occurrences
battery artillery passing front regiment
horse ammunition cart put leg over trace
hey look trace horse 
don see came identical shouts from ranks all along regiment
another time general attention attracted small brown dog coming heaven knows whence trotted preoccupied manner front ranks tail stiffly erect till suddenly shell fell close when yelped tucked tail between legs darted aside
yells shrieks laughter rose from whole regiment
such distractions lasted only moment eight hours men been inactive without food constant fear death their pale gloomy faces grew ever paler gloomier
prince andrew pale gloomy like everyone regiment paced down from border one patch another edge meadow beside oatfield head bowed arms behind back
there nothing orders given
everything went itself
killed dragged from front wounded carried away ranks closed 
soldiers ran rear returned immediately hastily
first prince andrew considering duty rouse courage men set example walked about among ranks soon became convinced unnecessary there nothing could teach 
all powers soul every soldier there unconsciously bent avoiding contemplation horrors their situation
walked along meadow dragging feet rustling grass gazing dust covered boots now took big strides trying keep footprints left meadow mowers counted steps calculating often must walk from one strip another walk mile stripped flowers from wormwood grew along boundary rut rubbed palms smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent
thought nothing
listened weary ears ever recurring sounds distinguishing whistle flying projectiles from booming reports glanced tiresomely familiar faces men first battalion waited
one coming our way again thought listening approaching whistle hidden region smoke
one another again hit
stopped looked ranks
one hit again started trying reach boundary strip sixteen paces
whizz thud five paces from cannon ball tore dry earth disappeared
probably many been hit large crowd gathered near second battalion
adjutant shouted
adjutant having obeyed instruction approached prince andrew
from other side battalion commander rode 
look out came frightened cry from soldier like bird whirring rapid flight alighting ground shell dropped little noise within two steps prince andrew close battalion commander horse
horse first regardless whether right wrong show fear snorted reared almost throwing major galloped aside
lie down cried adjutant throwing himself flat ground
prince andrew hesitated
smoking shell spun like top between prostrate adjutant near wormwood plant between field meadow
can death thought prince andrew looking quite new envious glance grass wormwood streamlet smoke curled from rotating black ball
cannot wish die
love life love grass earth air
thought same time remembered people looking 
shameful sir said adjutant
did finish speaking
one same moment came sound explosion whistle splinters from breaking window frame suffocating smell powder prince andrew started one side raising arm fell chest
from right side abdomen blood welling out making large stain grass
militiamen stretchers called stood behind officers
prince andrew lay chest face grass breathing heavily noisily
are waiting come along peasants went took shoulders legs moaned piteously exchanging looks set down again
pick lift all same cried someone
again took shoulders laid stretcher
god god stomach means death god voices among officers heard saying
flew hair breadth past ear said adjutant
peasants adjusting stretcher their shoulders started hurriedly along path trodden down dressing station
keep step 
those peasants shouted officer seizing their shoulders checking peasants walking unevenly jolting stretcher
get into step dor
say dor said foremost peasant
now right said one behind joyfully when got into step
your excellency prince said trembling voice tim khin run looking down stretcher
prince andrew opened eyes looked speaker from stretcher into head sunk deep again eyelids drooped
militiamen carried prince andrew dressing station wood where wagons stationed
dressing station consisted three tents flaps turned back pitched edge birch wood
wood wagons horses standing
horses eating oats from their movable troughs sparrows flew down pecked grains fell
crows scenting blood flew among birch trees cawing impatiently
around tents over more than five acres bloodstained men various garbs stood sat lay
around wounded stood crowds soldier stretcher bearers dismal attentive faces whom officers keeping order tried vain drive from spot
disregarding officers orders soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers gazing intently trying comprehend difficult problem taking place before 
from tents came now loud angry cries now plaintive groans
occasionally dressers ran out fetch water point out those brought next
wounded men awaiting their turn outside tents groaned sighed wept screamed swore asked vodka
prince andrew bearers stepping over wounded yet been bandaged took regimental commander close one tents there stopped awaiting instructions
prince andrew opened eyes long time could make out going around 
remembered meadow wormwood field whirling black ball sudden rush passionate love life
two steps from leaning against branch talking loudly attracting general attention stood tall handsome black haired noncommissioned officer bandaged head
been wounded head leg bullets
around eagerly listening talk crowd wounded stretcher bearers gathered
kicked out from there chucked everything grabbed king himself cried looking around eyes glittered fever
only reserves come just lads there wouldn been nothing left tell surely
like all others near speaker prince andrew looked shining eyes experienced sense comfort
isn all same now thought 
will there there been why reluctant part life there something life did understand
one doctors came out tent bloodstained apron holding cigar between thumb little finger one small bloodstained hands smear 
raised head looked about above level wounded men
after turning head from right left time sighed looked down
all right immediately replied dresser pointed prince andrew out told carry into tent
murmurs arose among wounded waiting
seems even next world only gentry are chance remarked one
prince andrew carried laid table only just been cleared dresser washing down
prince andrew could make out distinctly tent
pitiful groans from all sides torturing pain thigh stomach back distracted 
all saw about merged into general impression naked bleeding human bodies seemed fill whole low tent few weeks previously hot august day such bodies filled dirty pond beside smol nsk road
yes same flesh same chair canon sight even filled horror presentiment
there three operating tables tent
two occupied third placed prince andrew
little left alone involuntarily witnessed taking place other two tables
nearest one sat tartar probably cossack judging uniform thrown down beside 
four soldiers holding spectacled doctor cutting into muscular brown back
ooh ooh ooh grunted tartar suddenly lifting swarthy snub nosed face high cheekbones baring white teeth began wriggle twitch body utter piercing ringing prolonged yells
other table round many people crowding tall well fed man lay backhead thrown back
curly hair color shape head seemed strangely familiar prince andrew
several dressers pressing chest hold down
one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all time feverish tremor
two doctors one whom pale trembling silently doing something man other gory leg
when finished tartar whom covered overcoat spectacled doctor came prince andrew wiping hands
glanced prince andrew face quickly turned away
undress are waiting cried angrily dressers
very first remotest recollections childhood came back prince andrew mind when dresser sleeves rolled began hastily undo buttons clothes undressed 
doctor bent down over wound felt sighed deeply
made sign someone torturing pain abdomen caused prince andrew lose consciousness
when came himself splintered portions thighbone been extracted torn flesh cut away wound bandaged
soon prince andrew opened eyes doctor bent over kissed silently lips hurried away
after sufferings been enduring prince andrew enjoyed blissful feeling such experienced long time
all best happiest moments life especially earliest childhood when used undressed put bed when leaning over nurse sang sleep burying head pillow felt happy mere consciousness life returned memory merely something past something present
doctors busily engaged wounded man shape whose head seemed familiar prince andrew lifting trying quiet 
show 
ooh frightened moans could heard subdued suffering broken sobs
hearing those moans prince andrew wanted weep
whether dying without glory sorry part life those memories childhood could return suffering others suffering man near groaning piteously felt like weeping childlike kindly almost happy tears
wounded man shown amputated leg stained clotted blood boot still 
ooh sobbed like woman
doctor been standing beside preventing prince andrew from seeing face moved away
god why said prince andrew himself
miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg just been amputated recognized anatole kur gin
men supporting their arms offering glass water trembling swollen lips could grasp rim
yes yes man somehow closely painfully connected thought prince andrew yet clearly grasping saw before 
connection man childhood life asked himself without finding answer
suddenly new unexpected memory from realm pure loving childhood presented itself 
remembered nat sha seen first time ball 1810 slender neck arms frightened happy face ready rapture love tenderness stronger more vivid than ever awoke soul
now remembered connection existed between himself man dimly gazing through tears filled swollen eyes
remembered everything ecstatic pity love man overflowed happy heart
prince andrew could longer restrain himself wept tender loving tears fellow men himself own their errors
compassion love our brothers those love those hate love our enemies yes love god preached earth princess mary taught did understand made sorry part life remained lived
know terrible spectacle battlefield covered dead wounded together heaviness head news twenty generals knew personally been killed wounded consciousness impotence once mighty arm produced unexpected impression napoleon usually liked look killed wounded thereby considered testing strength mind
day horrible appearance battlefield overcame strength mind thought constituted merit greatness
rode hurriedly from battlefield returned shev rdino knoll where sat campstool sallow face swollen heavy eyes dim nose red voice hoarse involuntarily listening downcast eyes sounds firing
painful dejection awaited end action regarded himself participant unable arrest
personal human feeling brief moment got better artificial phantasm life served long
felt own person sufferings death witnessed battlefield
heaviness head chest reminded possibility suffering death himself
moment did desire moscow victory glory need more glory 
one thing wished rest tranquillity freedom
when been sem novsk heights artillery commander proposed bring several batteries artillery those heights strengthen fire russian troops crowded front knyazk 
napoleon assented given orders news should brought effect those batteries produced
adjutant came now inform fire two hundred guns been concentrated russians ordered still held their ground
our fire mowing down rows still hold said adjutant
want more 
sire asked adjutant heard remark
want more croaked napoleon frowning
let even before gave order thing did desire gave order only thought expected being done
fell back into artificial realm imaginary greatness again horse walking treadmill thinks doing something itself submissively fulfilled cruel sad gloomy inhuman role predestined 
day hour alone mind conscience darkened man whom responsibility happening lay more than all others took part 
never end life could understand goodness beauty truth significance actions contrary goodness truth remote from everything human ever able grasp their meaning
could disavow actions belauded half world repudiate truth goodness all humanity
only day rode over battlefield strewn men killed maimed will believed did reckon looked many russians there each frenchmandeceiving himself find reason rejoicing calculation there five russians every frenchman
day alone did write letter paris battle field superb fifty thousand corpses lay there even island 
helena peaceful solitude where said intended devote leisure account great deeds done wrote russian war should been most popular war modern times war good sense real interests tranquillity security all purely pacific conservative
war great cause end uncertainties beginning security
new horizon new labors opening out full well being prosperity all
european system already founded all remained organize 
satisfied great points tranquility everywhere should congress holy alliance
those ideas stolen from 
reunion great sovereigns should discussed our interests like one family rendered account peoples clerk master
europe would way soon been fact one people anyone traveled anywhere would found himself always common fatherland
should demanded freedom all navigable rivers everybody seas should common all great standing armies should reduced henceforth mere guards sovereigns
returning france bosom great strong magnificent peaceful glorious fatherland should proclaimed frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all aggrandizement antinational
should associated son empire dictatorship would been finished constitutional reign would begun

four hundred thousand crossed vistula wrote further russian war half austrians prussians saxons poles bavarians rttembergers mecklenburgers spaniards italians neapolitans
imperial army strictly speaking one third composed dutch belgians men from borders rhine piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans romans inhabitants thirty second military division bremen hamburg included scarcely hundred forty thousand spoke french
russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousandmen russian army retreat from lna moscow lost various battles four times more men than french army burning moscow cost lives hundred thousandrussians died cold want woods finally march from moscow oder russian army also suffered from severity season time reached lna numbered only fifty thousandlisch less than eighteen thousand
imagined war russia came about will horrors occurred did stagger soul
boldly took whole responsibility happened darkened mind found justification belief among hundreds thousands perished there fewer frenchmen than hessians bavarians
several tens thousands slain lay diverse postures various uniforms fields meadows belonging dav dov family crown serfs those fields meadows where hundreds years peasants borodin rki shev rdino sem novsk reaped their harvests pastured their cattle
dressing stations grass earth soaked blood space three acres around
crowds men various arms wounded unwounded frightened faces dragged themselves back mozh ysk from one army back val evo from other
other crowds exhausted hungry went forward led their officers
others held their ground continued fire
over whole field previously gaily beautiful glitter bayonets cloudlets smoke morning sun there now spread mist damp smoke strange acid smell saltpeter blood
clouds gathered drops rain began fall dead wounded frightened exhausted hesitating men say enough men enough cease
bethink yourselves are doing men both sides alike worn out want food rest began equally appear doubtful whether should continue slaughter one another all faces expressed hesitation question arose every soul whom must kill killed 
may kill whom please don want more evening thought ripened every soul
moment men might been seized horror doing might thrown everything run away anywhere
though toward end battle men felt all horror doing though would been glad leave off incomprehensible mysterious power continued control still brought charges loaded aimed applied match though only one artilleryman survived out every three though stumbled panted fatigue perspiring stained blood powder
cannon balls flew just swiftly cruelly from both sides crushing human bodies terrible work done will man will governs men worlds continued
anyone looking disorganized rear russian army would said only french made one more slight effort would disappear anyone looking rear french army would said russians need only make one more slight effort french would destroyed
neither french nor russians made effort flame battle burned slowly out
russians did make effort attacking french
beginningbattle stood blocking way moscow still did end battle beginning
even aim russians been drive french from their positions could made last effort all russian troops been broken there part russian armysuffered battle though still holding their positions lost one half their army
french memory all their former victories during fifteen years assurance napoleon invincibility consciousness captured part battlefield lost only quarter their men still their guards intact twenty thousand strong might easily made effort
french attacked russian army order drive from position ought made effort long russians continued block road moscow before aim french been attained all their efforts losses vain
french did make effort
historians say napoleon need only used old guards intact battle would been won
speak would happened napoleon sent guards like talking would happen autumn became spring
napoleon did give guards did want could done
all generals officers soldiers french army knew could done flagging spirit troops would permit 
napoleon alone experienced nightmare feeling mighty arm being stricken powerless all generals soldiers army whether taken part battleafter all their experience previous battles when after one tenth such efforts enemy fled experienced similar feeling terror before enemy after losing half men stood threateningly end beginning battle
moral force attacking french army exhausted
sort victory defined capture pieces material fastened sticks called standards ground troops stood standing moral victory convinces enemy moral superiority opponent own impotence gained russians borodin 
french invaders like infuriated animal onslaught received mortal wound felt perishing could stop more than russian army weaker one half could help swerving
impetus gained french army still able roll forward moscow there without further effort part russians perish bleeding from mortal wound received borodin 
direct consequence battle borodin napoleon senseless flight from moscow retreat along old smol nsk road destruction invading army five hundred thousand men downfall napoleonic france borodin first time hand opponent stronger spirit been laid

historical science endeavor draw nearer truth continually takes smaller smaller units examination
however small units takes feel take unit disconnected from others assume beginning phenomenon say will many men expressed actions one historic personage itself false

forces dozen european nations burst into russia
russian army people avoided collision till smol nsk reached again from smol nsk borodin 
french army pushed moscow goal impetus ever increasing neared aim just velocity falling body increases approaches earth
behind seven hundred miles hunger stricken hostile country ahead few dozen miles separating from goal
every soldier napoleon army felt invasion moved own momentum
more russian army retreated more fiercely spirit hatred enemy flared retreated army increased consolidated
neither army broken russian army retreated immediately after collision inevitably ball recoils after colliding another having greater momentum equal inevitability ball invasion advanced such momentum rolled distance though collision deprived all force
russians retreated eighty miles beyond moscow french reached moscow there came standstill
five weeks after there single battle
bleeding mortally wounded animal licks wounds remained inert moscow five weeks suddenly fresh reason fled back made dash kal road after victory yarosl vets field conflict again remained theirs without undertaking single serious battle fled stillmore rapidly back smol nsk beyond smol nsk beyond ber zina beyond lna farther still
evening twenty sixth august kut zov whole russian army convinced battle borodin victory
kut zov reported emperor
gave orders prepare fresh conflict finish enemy did deceive anyone knew enemy beaten everyone taken part battle knew 
all evening next day reports came one after another unheard losses loss half army fresh battle proved physically impossible
impossible give battle before information been collected wounded gathered supplies ammunition replenished slain reckoned new officers appointed replace those been killed before men food sleep
meanwhile very next morning after battle french army advanced itself upon russians carried forward force own momentum now seemingly increased inverse proportion square distance from aim
kut zov wish attack next day whole army desired 
make attack wish sufficient there must also possibility doing possibility did exist
impossible retreat day march same way impossible retreat another third day march last first september when army drew near moscowdespite strength feeling arisen all ranks force circumstances compelled retire beyond moscow
troops retired one more last day march abandoned moscow enemy
people accustomed think plans campaign battles are made generals anyone sitting over map study may imagine would arranged things battle questions present themselves why did kut zov during retreat why did take position before reaching fil why did retire once kal road abandoning moscow 
people accustomed think way forget know inevitable conditions always limit activities commander chief
activity commander chief does all resemble activity imagine ourselves when sit ease our studies examining campaign map certain number troops side certain known locality begin our plans from given moment
commander chief never dealing beginning event position from always contemplate 
commander chief always midst series shifting events never can moment consider whole import event occurring
moment moment event imperceptibly shaping itself every moment continuous uninterrupted shaping events commander chief midst most complex play intrigues worries contingencies authorities projects counsels threats deceptions continually obliged reply innumerable questions addressed constantly conflict one another
learned military authorities quite seriously tell kut zov should moved army kal road long before reaching fil somebody actually submitted such proposal 
commander chief especially difficult moment always before one proposal dozens simultaneously
all proposals based strategics tactics contradict each other
commander chief business would seem simply choose one projects
instance twenty eighth suggested cross kal road just adjutant gallops from milor dovich asking whether engage french retire
order must given once instant
order retreat carries past turn kal road
after adjutant comes commissary general asking where stores are taken chief hospitals asks where wounded are courier from petersburg brings letter from sovereign does admit possibility abandoning moscow commander chief rival man undermining there are always merely one several such presents new project diametrically opposed turning kal road commander chief himself needs sleep refreshment maintain energy respectable general been overlooked distribution rewards comes complain inhabitants district pray defended officer sent inspect locality comes gives report quite contrary said officer previously sent spy prisoner general been reconnaissance all describe position enemy army differently
people accustomed misunderstand forget inevitable conditions commander chief actions describe instance position army fil assume commander chief could first september quite freely decide whether abandon moscow defend whereas russian army less than four miles from moscow such question existed
when question been settled drissa smol nsk most palpably all twenty fourth august shev rdino twenty sixth borodin each day hour minute retreat from borodin fil 
when erm lov having been sent kut zov inspect position told field marshal impossible fight there before moscow must retreat kut zov looked silence
give your hand said turning over feel pulse added are well dear fellow
think are saying kut zov could yet admit possibility retreating beyond moscow without battle
pokl nny hill four miles from dorogom lov gate moscow kut zov got out carriage sat down bench roadside
great crowd generals gathered round count rostopch come out from moscow joined 
brilliant company separated into several groups all discussed advantages disadvantages position state army plans suggested situation moscow military questions generally
though been summoned purpose though called all felt really council war
conversations all dealt public questions
anyone gave asked personal news done whisper immediately reverted general matters
jokes laughter smiles even seen among all men
evidently all made effort hold themselves height situation demanded
all groups talking among themselves tried keep near commander chief whose bench formed center gathering speak might overhear 
commander chief listened being said sometimes asked repeat their remarks did himself take part conversations express opinion
after hearing being said one other groups generally turned away air disappointment though speaking anything wished hear
discussed position been chosen criticizing position itself much mental capacity those chosen 
others argued mistake been made earlier battle should been fought two days before
others again spoke battle salamanca described crosart newly arrived frenchman spanish uniform
frenchman one german princes serving russian army discussing siege saragossa considering possibility defending moscow similar manner
count rostopch telling fourth group prepared die city train bands under walls capital still could help regretting having been left ignorance happening known sooner things would been different
fifth group displaying profundity their strategic perceptions discussed direction troops would now take
sixth group talking absolute nonsense
kut zov expression grew more more preoccupied gloomy
from all talk saw only one thing defend moscow physical impossibility full meaning those words say utterly impossible senseless commander give orders fight confusion would result battle would still take place
would take place commanders merely all recognized position impossible their conversations only discussing would happen after inevitable abandonment
could commanders lead their troops field battle considered impossible hold lower grade officers even soldiers reason also considered position impossible therefore could fight fully convinced defeat
bennigsen insisted position being defended others still discussed question longer important itself only pretext disputes intrigue
kut zov knew well
bennigsen chosen position warmly displayed russian patriotism kut zov could listen without wincing insisting moscow must defended
aim clear daylight kut zov defense failed throw blame kut zov brought army far sparrow hills without giving battle succeeded claim success own battle given clear himself crime abandoning moscow
intrigue did now occupy old man mind
one terrible question absorbed question heard reply from anyone
question now really allowed napoleon reach moscow when did when decided can been yesterday when ordered tov retreat evening before when nap told bennigsen issue orders earlier still 
when when terrible affair decided moscow must abandoned
army must retreat order must given
give terrible order seemed equivalent resigning command army
only did love power accustomed honours awarded prince prozor vski under whom served turkey galled convinced destined save russia why against emperor wish will people been chosen commander chief
convinced alone could maintain command army difficult circumstances all world alone could encounter invincible napoleon without fear horrified thought order issue
something decided conversations around assuming free character must stopped
called most important generals 
head good bad must depend itself said rising from bench rode fil where carriages waiting
council war began assemble two afternoon better roomier part andrew savosty nov hut
men women children large peasant family crowded into back room across passage
only mal sha andrew six year old granddaughter whom serene highness petted whom given lump sugar drinking tea remained top brick oven larger room
mal sha looked down from oven shy delight faces uniforms decorations generals one after another came into room sat down broad benches corner under icons
granddad himself mal sha own mind called kut zov sat apart dark corner behind oven
sat sunk deep folding armchair continually cleared throat pulled collar coat though unbuttoned still seemed pinch neck
those entered went one one field marshal pressed hands nodded others
adjutant kays rov about draw back curtain window facing kut zov latter moved hand angrily kays rov understood serene highness did wish face seen
round peasant deal tablelay maps plans pencils papers many people gathered orderlies brought another bench put beside table
erm lov kays rov toll just arrived sat down bench
foremost place immediately under icons sat barclay tolly high forehead merging into bald crown
george cross round neck looked pale ill
been feverish two days now shivering pain
beside sat rov rapid gesticulations giving information speaking low tones all did
chubby little dokht rov listening attentively eyebrows raised arms folded stomach
other side sat count ostermann tolst seemingly absorbed own thoughts
broad head bold features glittering eyes resting hand
vski twitching forward black hair temples habit glanced now kut zov now door look impatience
konovn tsyn firm handsome kindly face lit tender sly smile
glance met mal sha expression eyes caused little girl smile
all waiting bennigsen pretext inspecting position finishing savory dinner
waited from four till six clock did begin their deliberations all time talked low tones other matters
only when bennigsen entered hut did kut zov leave corner draw toward table near enough candles been placed there light face
bennigsen opened council question are abandon russia ancient sacred capital without struggle are defend prolonged general silence followed
there frown every face only kut zov angry grunts occasional cough broke silence
nearest saw face puckered seemed about cry did last long
russia ancient sacred capital suddenly said repeating bennigsen words angry voice thereby drawing attention false note 
allow tell your excellency question meaning russian
lurched heavy body forward
such question cannot put senseless question asked gentlemen meet discuss military one
question saving russia
better give moscow without battle accepting battle risk losing army well moscow question want your opinion sank back chair
discussion began
admitting view barclay others defensive battle fil impossible imbued russian patriotism love moscow proposed move troops from right left flank during night attack french right flank following day
opinions divided arguments advanced against project
erm lov dokht rov vski agreed bennigsen
whether feeling necessary make sacrifice before abandoning capital guided other personal considerations generals seemed understand council could alter inevitable course events moscow effect already abandoned
other generals however understood leaving aside question moscow spoke direction army should take retreat
mal sha kept eyes fixed going before understood meaning council differently
seemed only personal struggle between granddad long coat termed bennigsen
saw grew spiteful when spoke one another heart sided granddad
midst conversation noticed granddad give bennigsen quick subtle glance joys saw granddad said something long coat settled 
bennigsen suddenly reddened paced angrily down room
affected kut zov calm quiet comment advantage disadvantage bennigsen proposal move troops night from right left flank attack french right wing
gentlemen said kut zov cannot approve count plan
moving troops close proximity enemy always dangerous military history supports view
kut zov seemed reflect searching example clear look bennigsen added yes take battle friedland think count well remembers 
fully successful only our troops rearranged near enemy
there followed momentary pause seemed very long all
discussion recommenced pauses frequently occurred all felt there more said
during one pauses kut zov heaved deep sigh preparing speak
well gentlemen see will pay broken crockery said rising slowly moved table
gentlemen heard your views
paused authority entrusted sovereign country order retreat
after generals began disperse solemnity circumspect silence people are leaving after funeral
generals low tones strain very different from way spoken during council communicated something their commander chief
mal sha long been expected supper climbed carefully backwards down from oven bare little feet catching projections slipping between legs generals darted out room
when dismissed generals kut zov sat long time elbows table thinking always same terrible question when when did abandonment moscow become inevitable when done settled matter blame did expect said adjutant schneider when latter came late night
did expect did think would happen
should take rest your serene highness replied schneider
shall eat horseflesh yet like turks exclaimed kut zov without replying striking table podgy fist
shall only
very time circumstances even more important than retreating without battle namely evacuation burning moscow rostopch usually represented being instigator event acted altogether different manner from kut zov
after battle borodin abandonment burning moscow inevitable retreat army beyond moscow without fighting
every russian might predicted reasoning feeling implanted each our fathers
same thing took place moscow happened all towns villages russian soil beginning smol nsk without participation count rostopch broadsheets
people awaited enemy unconcernedly did riot become excited tear anyone pieces faced fate feeling within strength find should most difficult moment
soon enemy drew near wealthy classes went away abandoning their property poorer remained burned destroyed left
consciousness would would always present heart every russian
consciousness foreboding moscow would taken present russian moscow society 1812
those quitted moscow already july beginning august showed expected 
those went away taking could abandoning their houses half their belongings did from latent patriotism expresses itself phrases giving one children save fatherland similar unnatural exploits unobtrusively simply organically therefore way always produces most powerful results
disgraceful run away from danger only cowards are running away from moscow told
broadsheets rostopch impressed leave moscow shameful
ashamed called cowards ashamed leave still left knowing done
why did impossible suppose rostopch scared accounts horrors napoleon committed conquered countries
first people away rich educated people knew quite well vienna berlin remained intact during napoleon occupation inhabitants spent their time pleasantly company charming frenchmen whom russians especially russian ladies liked much
went away russians there could question whether things would well ill under french rule moscow
out question under french rule would worst thing could happen
went away even before battle borodin still more rapidly after despite rostopch calls defend moscow announcement intention take wonder working icon iberian mother god fight balloons destroy french despite all nonsense rostopch wrote broadsheets
knew army fight could succeed would take young ladies house serfs three hills quarter moscow fight napoleon must away sorry abandon their property destruction
went away without thinking tremendous significance immense wealthy city being given over destruction great city wooden buildings certain when abandoned inhabitants burned
went away each own account yet only consequence their going away momentous event accomplished will always remain greatest glory russian people
lady afraid being stopped count rostopch orders already june moved negroes women jesters from moscow sar tov estate vague consciousness bonaparte servant really simply truly carrying out great work saved russia
count rostopch now taunted those left moscow now government offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons drunken rabble now processions displaying icons now forbade father augustin remove icons relics saints now seized all private carts moscow one hundred thirty six removed balloon being constructed leppich now hinted would burn moscow related set fire own house now wrote proclamation french solemnly upbraiding having destroyed orphanage now claimed glory having hinted would burn moscow now repudiated deed now ordered people catch all spies bring now reproached doing now expelled all french residents from moscow now allowed madame aubert chalm center whole french colony moscow remain ordered venerable old postmaster klyuchar arrested exiled particular offense now assembled people three hills fight french now get rid handed over man killed himself drove away back gate now declared would survive fall moscow now wrote french verses albums concerning share affair man did understand meaning happening merely wanted something himself would astonish people perform patriotically heroic feat like child made sport momentous unavoidable event abandonment burning moscow tried puny hand now speed now stay enormous popular tide bore along

such ordinary conditions life nowhere found
though shells bullets did whistle over road along going still all sides there there been field battle
there still same suffering exhausted sometimes strangely indifferent faces same blood same soldiers overcoats same sounds firing though distant now still aroused terror besides there foul air dust
having gone couple miles along mozh ysk road pierre sat down roadside
dusk fallen roar guns died away
pierre lay leaning elbow long time gazing shadows moved past darkness
continually imagining cannon ball flying toward terrific whizz shuddered sat 
idea long been there
middle night three soldiers having brought firewood settled down near began lighting fire

pleasant odor greasy viands mingled smell smoke
three soldiers eating talking among themselves taking notice

whole courtyard permeated strong peaceful smell stable yards delightful pierre moment
could see clear starry sky between dark roofs two penthouses
thank god there more thought covering head again

evening first september after interview kut zov count rostopch returned moscow mortified offended been invited attend council war kut zov paid attention offer take part defense city amazed also novel outlook revealed camp treated tranquillity capital patriotic fervor merely secondary quite irrelevant unimportant matters
distressed offended surprised all rostopch returned moscow
after supper lay down sofa without undressing awakened soon after midnight courier bringing letter from kut zov
letter requested count send police officers guide troops through town army retreating ryaz road beyond moscow
known moscow would abandoned merely since interview previous day kut zov pokl nny hill ever since battle borodin all generals came moscow after battle said unanimously impossible fight another battle since government property been removed every night half inhabitants left city rostopch own permission
yet all same information astonished irritated count coming did form simple note order from kut zov received night breaking beauty sleep
when later memoirs count rostopch explained actions time repeatedly says actuated two important considerations maintain tranquillity moscow expedite departure inhabitants
one accepts twofold aim all rostopch actions appear irreproachable
why holy relics arms ammunition gunpowder stores corn removed why thousands inhabitants deceived into believing moscow would given thereby ruined preserve tranquillity city explains count rostopch 
why bundles useless papers from government offices leppich balloon other articles removed leave town empty explains count rostopch 
one need only admit public tranquillity danger action finds justification
all horrors reign terror based only solicitude public tranquillity
count rostopch fear tranquillity moscow based 1812 reason there assuming probability uprising city inhabitants leaving retreating troops filling 
why should cause masses riot neither moscow nor anywhere russia did anything resembling insurrection ever occur when enemy entered town
more than ten thousand people still moscow first second september except mob governor courtyard assembled there bidding nothing happened
obvious there would been even less reason expect disturbance among people after battle borodin when surrender moscow became certain least probable rostopch instead exciting people distributing arms broadsheets taken steps remove all holy relics gunpowder munitions money told population plainly town would abandoned
rostopch though patriotic sentiments sanguine impulsive man always moved highest administrative circles understanding all people supposed himself guiding
ever since enemy entry into smol nsk imagination been playing role director popular feeling heart russia
only did seem all administrators controlled external actions moscow inhabitants also thought controlled their mental attitude means broadsheets posters written coarse tone people despise their own class understand from those authority
rostopch pleased fine role leader popular feeling grown used necessity relinquishing role abandoning moscow without heroic display took unawares suddenly felt ground slip away from under feet positively did know 
though knew coming did till last moment wholeheartedly believe moscow would abandoned did prepare 
government offices removed only done demand officials whom count yielded reluctantly
absorbed role created himself
often case those gifted ardent imagination though long known moscow would abandoned knew only intellect did believe heart did adapt himself mentally new position affairs
all painstaking energetic activity far useful effect people another question been simply directed toward arousing masses own feeling patriotic hatred french
when events assumed their true historical character when expressing hatred french words proved insufficient when even possible express hatred fighting battle when self confidence avail relation one question before moscow when whole population streamed out moscow one man abandoning their belongings proving negative action all depth their national feeling role chosen rostopch suddenly appeared senseless
unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous weak alone ground stand 
when awakened from sleep received cold peremptory note from kut zov felt more irritated more felt himself blame
all been specially put charge state property should removed still moscow longer possible take whole away
blame let things come such pass ruminated
moscow firmly hand
let come villains traitors thought without clearly defining villains traitors feeling necessary hate those traitors whoever might blame false ridiculous position found himself
all night count rostopch issued orders people came from all parts moscow
those about never seen count morose irritable
your excellency director registrar department sent instructions
from consistory from senate from university from foundling hospital suffragan sent
are your orders about fire brigade from governor prison
from superintendent lunatic asylum
all night long such announcements continually being received count
all inquiries gave brief angry replies indicating orders from now needed whole affair carefully prepared now been ruined somebody somebody would bear whole responsibility all might happen
tell blockhead said reply question from registrar department should remain guard documents
now why are asking silly questions about fire brigade horses let off vlad mir leave french
your excellency superintendent lunatic asylum come are your commands commands let away all
let lunatics out into town
when lunatics command our armies god evidently means other madmen free
reply inquiry about convicts prison count rostopch shouted angrily governor expect give two battalions got convoy release all about your excellency there are political prisoners meshk vereshch gin
vereshch gin hasn been hanged yet shouted rostopch 
bring toward nine clock morning when troops already moving through moscow nobody came count more instructions
those able get away going their own accord those remained behind decided themselves must 
count ordered carriage might drive sok lniki sat study folded hands morose sallow taciturn
quiet untroubled times seems every administrator only effortswhole population under rule kept going consciousness being indispensable every administrator finds chief reward labor efforts
sea history remains calm ruler administrator frail bark holding boat hook ship people himself moving naturally imagines efforts move ship holding 
soon storm arises sea begins heave ship move such delusion longer possible
ship moves independently own enormous motion boat hook longer reaches moving vessel suddenly administrator instead appearing ruler source power becomes insignificant useless feeble man
rostopch felt exasperated 
superintendent police whom crowd stopped went see same time adjutant informed count horses harnessed
both pale superintendent police after reporting executed instructions received informed count immense crowd collected courtyard wished see 
without saying word rostopch rose walked hastily light luxurious drawing room went balcony door took hold handle let again went window from better view whole crowd

crowd moved eagerly from balcony toward porch
rostopch coming out there quick angry steps looked hastily around seeking someone

inflamed sight raised arm addressed people almost shouting deal think fit hand over 
crowd remained silent only pressed closer closer one another
keep one another back breathe stifling atmosphere unable stir await something unknown uncomprehended terrible becoming unbearable
those standing front seen heard taken place before all stood wide open eyes mouths straining all their strength held back crowd pushing behind 
beat

hearing much words angry tone rostopch voice crowd moaned heaved forward again paused
count exclaimed timid yet theatrical voice vereshch gin midst momentary silence ensued count one god above both
lifted head again thick vein thin neck filled blood color rapidly came went face

draw sabers cried dragoon officer drawing own
another still stronger wave flowed through crowd reaching front ranks carried swaying very steps porch
tall youth stony look face rigid uplifted arm stood beside vereshch gin
saber dragoon officer almost whispered
one soldiers face all once distorted fury struck vereshch gin head blunt side saber
cried vereshch gin meek surprise looking round frightened glance understanding why done 
similar moan surprise horror ran through crowd
lord exclaimed sorrowful voice
after exclamation surprise escaped from vereshch gin uttered plaintive cry pain cry fatal
barrier human feeling strained utmost held crowd check suddenly broke
plaintive moan reproach drowned threatening angry roar crowd

dragoon about repeat blow
vereshch gin cry horror covering head hands rushed toward crowd
tall youth against whom stumbled seized thin neck hands yelling wildly fell under feet pressing struggling crowd
beat tore vereshch gin others tall youth
screams those being trampled those tried rescue tall lad only increased fury crowd
long time before dragoons could extricate bleeding youth beaten almost death
long time despite feverish haste mob tried end work been begun those hitting throttling tearing vereshch gin unable kill crowd pressed from all sides swaying one mass center rendering impossible either kill let 
hit 
use hatchet 
still alive only when victim ceased struggle cries changed long drawn measured death rattle did crowd around prostrate bleeding corpse begin rapidly change places
each one came glanced been done horror reproach astonishment pushed back again
lord people are like wild beasts could alive voices crowd could heard saying

said same mob now looking pained distress dead body long thin half severed neck livid face stained blood dust
painstaking police officer considering presence corpse excellency courtyard unseemly told dragoons take away
two dragoons took distorted legs dragged along ground
gory dust stained half shaven head long neck trailed twisting along ground
moment when vereshch gin fell crowd closed savage yells swayed about rostopch suddenly turned pale instead going back entrance where carriage awaited went hurried steps bent head knowing where why along passage leading rooms ground floor
count face white could control feverish twitching lower jaw

been simply theodore vas lyevich course action would been quite different duty safeguard life dignity commander chief
lightly swaying flexible springs carriage longer hearing terrible sounds crowd rostopch grew physically calm always happens soon became physically tranquil mind devised reasons why should mentally tranquil 
thought tranquillized rostopch new one
since world began men killed one another one ever committed such crime against fellow man without comforting himself same idea
idea bien public hypothetical welfare other people
man swayed passion welfare never certain commits such crime always knows just where welfare lies
rostopch now knew 
only did reason reproach done even found cause self satisfaction having successfully contrived avail himself convenient opportunity punish criminal same time pacify mob
vereshch gin tried condemned death thought rostopch though senate only condemned vereshch gin hard labor traitor spy
could let unpunished killed two birds one stone appease mob gave victim same time punished miscreant
having reached country house begun give orders about domestic arrangements count grew quite tranquil
half hour later driving fast horses across sok lniki field longer thinking occurred considering come

strange say governor moscow proud count rostopch took cossack whip went bridge where began shouts drive carts blocked way
toward four clock afternoon murat troops entering moscow
front rode detachment rttemberg hussars behind rode king naples himself accompanied numerous suite
about middle arb street near church miraculous icon 
nicholas murat halted await news from advanced detachment condition found citadel kremlin
around murat gathered group those remained moscow
all stared timid bewilderment strange long haired commander dressed feathers gold
their tsar himself bad low voices could heard saying
interpreter rode group
take off your cap
your caps words went from one another crowd
interpreter addressed old porter asked far mlin
porter listening perplexity unfamiliar polish accent realizing interpreter speaking russian did understand being said slipped behind others
murat approached interpreter told ask where russian army 
one russians understood asked several voices once began answering interpreter
french officer returning from advanced detachment rode murat reported gates citadel been barricaded thereprobably ambuscade there
good said murat turning one gentlemen suite ordered four light guns moved forward fire gates
guns emerged trot from column following murat advanced arb 
when reached end vozdv zhenka street halted drew square
several french officers superintended placing guns looked mlin through field glasses
bells mlin ringing vespers sound troubled french
few infantrymen ran kut fyev gate
beams wooden screens been put there two musket shots rang out from under gate soon officer men began run toward 
general standing guns shouted words command officer latter ran back again men
sound three more shots came from gate
one shot struck french soldier foot from behind screens came strange sound few voices shouting
instantly word command expression cheerful serenity faces french general officers men changed one determined concentrated readiness strife suffering
all from marshal least soldier place vozdv zhenka mokhav kut fyev street nor itsa gate places familiar moscow new battlefield would probably prove sanguinary
all made ready battle
guns advanced artillerymen blew ash off their linstocks officer gave word fire followed two whistling sounds canister shot one after another
shot rattled against stone gate upon wooden beams screens two wavering clouds smoke rose over square
few instants after echo reports resounding over stone built mlin died away french heard strange sound above their head
thousands crows rose above walls circled air cawing noisily flapping their wings
together sound came solitary human cry from gateway amid smoke appeared figure bareheaded man peasant coat
grasped musket took aim french
fire repeated officer once more reports musket two cannon shots heard simultaneously
gate again hidden smoke
nothing more stirred behind screens french infantry soldiers officers advanced gate
gateway lay three wounded four dead
two men peasant coats ran away foot wall toward menka
clear away said officer pointing beams corpses french soldiers after dispatching wounded threw corpses over parapet
men nobody knew
clear away all said thrown over parapet removed later might stink
thiers alone dedicates few eloquent lines their memory wretches occupied sacred citadel having supplied themselves guns from arsenal fired wretches french
sabered mlin purged their presence
murat informed way been cleared
french entered gates began pitching their camp senate square
out windows senate house soldiers threw chairs into square fuel kindled fires there
other detachments passed through mlin encamped along moros yka luby nka pokr vka streets
others quartered themselves along vozdv zhenka nik lski tversk streets
masters houses being found anywhere french billeted inhabitants usual towns lived camp
though tattered hungry worn out reduced third their original number french entered moscow good marching order
weary famished still fighting menacing army
remained army only until soldiers dispersed into their different lodgings
soon men various regiments began disperse among wealthy deserted houses army lost forever there came into being something nondescript neither citizens nor soldiers are known marauders
when five weeks later same men left moscow longer formed army
mob marauders each carrying quantity articles seemed valuable useful
aim each man when left moscow longer been conquer merely keep acquired
like monkey puts paw into narrow neck jug having seized handful nutswill open fist fear losing holds therefore perishes french when left moscow inevitably perish carried their loot yet abandon stolen impossible monkey open paw let nuts
ten minutes after each regiment entered moscow district soldier officer left
men military uniforms hessian boots could seen through windows laughing walking through rooms
cellars storerooms similar men busy among provisions yards unlocking breaking open coach house stable doors lighting fires kitchens kneading baking bread rolled sleeves cooking frightening amusing caressing women children
there many such men both shops houses there army
order after order issued french commanders day forbidding men disperse about town sternly forbidding violence inhabitants looting announcing roll call very evening
despite all measures men till constituted army flowed all over wealthy deserted city comforts plentiful supplies
hungry herd cattle keeps well together when crossing barren field gets out hand once disperses uncontrollably soon reaches rich pastures did army disperse all over wealthy city
residents left moscow soldiers like water percolating through sand spread irresistibly through city all directions from mlin into first marched
cavalry entering merchant house been abandoned finding there stabling more than sufficient their horses went all same next house seemed better
many appropriated several houses chalked their names quarreled even fought other companies 
before time secure quarters soldiers ran out into streets see city hearing everything been abandoned rushed places where valuables taking
officers followed check soldiers involuntarily drawn into doing same
carriage row carriages been left shops generals flocked there select cal ches coaches themselves
few inhabitants remained invited commanding officers their houses hoping thereby secure themselves from being plundered
there masses wealth there seemed end 
all around quarters occupied french other regions still unexplored unoccupied where thought yet greater riches might found
moscow engulfed army ever deeperdeeper
when water spilled dry ground both dry ground water disappear mud results same way entry famished army into rich deserted cityresulted fires looting destruction both army wealthy city
frenchattributed fire moscow patriotisme roce rostopch russians barbarity french
reality however could possible explain burning moscow making individual group people responsible 
moscow burned found itself position town built wood bound burn quite apart from whether hundred thirty inferior fire engines
deserted moscow burn inevitably heap shavings burn sparks continually fall several days
town built wood where scarcely daypasses without conflagrations when house owners are residence police force present cannot help burning when inhabitants left occupied soldiers smoke pipes make campfires senate chairs senate square cook themselves meals twice day
peacetime only necessary billet troops villages district number fires district immediately increases
much must probability fire increased abandoned wooden town where foreign troops are quartered
patriotisme roce rostopch barbarity french blame matter
moscow set fire soldiers pipes kitchens campfires carelessness enemy soldiers occupying houses did own
even there arson very doubtful one reason burn houses case troublesome dangerous thing arson cannot regarded cause same thing would happened without incendiarism
however tempting might french blame rostopch ferocity russians blame scoundrel bonaparte later place heroic torch hands their own people impossible see there could such direct cause fire moscow burn every village factory house must burn left owners strangers are allowed live cook their porridge
moscow burned inhabitants true those abandoned those remained 
moscow when occupied enemy did remain intact like berlin vienna other towns simply inhabitants abandoned did welcome french bread salt nor bring keys city
absorption french moscow radiating starwise did only reached quarter where pierre staying evening second september
after last two days spent solitude unusual circumstances pierre state bordering insanity
completely obsessed one persistent thought
did know when thought taken such possession remembered nothing past understood nothing present all saw heard appeared like dream
left home only escape intricate tangle life demands enmeshed present condition unable unravel
gone joseph alex evich house plea sorting deceased books papers only search rest from life turmoil mind memory joseph alex evich connected world eternal solemn calm thoughts quite contrary restless confusion into felt himself being drawn
sought quiet refuge joseph alex evich study really found 
when sat elbows dusty writing table deathlike stillness study calm significant memories last few days rose one after another imagination particularly battle borodin vague sense own insignificance insincerity compared truth simplicity strength class men mentally classed 
when ger sim roused from reverie idea occurred taking part popular defense moscow knew projected
object asked ger sim get peasant coat pistol confiding intentions remaining joseph alex evich house keeping name secret
during first day spent inaction solitude tried several times fix attention masonic manuscripts unable idea previously occurred cabalistic significance name connection bonaparte more than once vaguely presented itself
idea russe besuhof destined set limit power beast yet only one fancies often passed through mind left trace behind
when having bought coat merely object taking part among people defense moscow pierre met rost nat sha said are remaining moscow 
splendid thought flashed into mind really would good thing even moscow taken remain there predestined 
next day sole idea sparing himself lagging way behind pierre went three hills gate
when returned house convinced moscow would defended suddenly felt before seemed merely possibility now become absolutely necessary inevitable
must remain moscow concealing name must meet napoleonkill either perish put end misery all europe seemed solely due napoleon
pierre knew all details attempt bonaparte life 1809 german student vienna knew student been shot
risk would expose life carrying out design excited still more
two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly purpose
first feeling necessity sacrifice suffering view common calamity same feeling caused mozh ysk twenty fifth make way very thick battle now caused run away from home place luxury comfort accustomed sleep hard sofa without undressing eat same food ger sim
other vague quite russian feeling contempt everything conventional artificial human everything majority men regard greatest good world
pierre first experienced strange fascinating feeling slob palace when suddenly felt wealth power life all men painstakingly acquire guard worth only reason joy can all renounced
feeling induces volunteer recruit spend last penny drink drunken man smash mirrors glasses apparent reason knowing will cost all money possesses feeling causes man perform actions from ordinary point view are insane test personal power strength affirming existence higher nonhuman criterion life
from very day pierre experienced feeling first time slob palace been continuously under influence only now found full satisfaction 
moreover moment pierre supported design prevented from renouncing already done direction
now leave moscow like everyone else flight from home peasant coat pistol announcement rost would remain moscow would all become merely meaningless contemptible ridiculous pierre very sensitive
pierre physical condition always case corresponded mental state
unaccustomed coarse food vodka drank during those days absence wine cigars dirty unchanged linen two almost sleepless nights passed short sofa without bedding all kept state excitement bordering insanity
two clock afternoon
french already entered moscow
pierre knew instead acting only thought about undertaking going over minutest details mind
fancy did clearly picture himself either striking blow death napoleon extraordinary vividness melancholy enjoyment imagined own destruction heroic endurance
yes alone sake all must perish thought
yes will approach
pistol dagger all same hand providence punishes thee shall say thought imagining would say when killing napoleon
well take execute went speaking himself bowing head sad firm expression
pierre standing middle room talking himself way study door opened threshold appeared figure mak alex evich always timid before now quite transformed

suddenly fresh sound piercing feminine scream reverberated from porch cook came running into vestibule
gracious heavens lord four horsemen cried
ger sim porter let mak alex evich now silent corridor sound several hands knocking front door could heard
pierre having decided until carried out design would disclose neither identity nor knowledge french stood half open door corridor intending conceal himself soon french entered
french entered still pierre did retire irresistible curiosity kept there
there two 
one officer tall soldierly handsome man other evidently private orderly sunburned short thin sunken cheeks dull expression

pierre wished away conceal himself moment saw mak alex evich appearing open kitchen door pistol hand
madman cunning mak alex evich eyed frenchman raised pistol took aim
board yelled tipsy man trying press trigger
hearing yell officer turned round same moment pierre threw himself drunkard
just when pierre snatched struck pistol mak alex evich last got fingers trigger there deafening report all enveloped cloud smoke

mak alex evich standing parted lips swaying about fall asleep leaned against wall
brigand shall pay said frenchman letting 
french are merciful after victory pardon traitors added look gloomy dignity fine energetic gesture
pierre continued french persuade officer hold drunken imbecile account
frenchman listened silence same gloomy expression suddenly turned pierre smile
few seconds looked silence
handsome face assumed melodramatically gentle expression held out hand
saved life
frenchman deduction indubitable
only frenchman could perform great deed save life life 
ramballe captain 13th light regiment undoubtedly very great deed
however indubitable conclusion officer conviction based upon pierre felt necessary disillusion 
russian said quickly
tut tut tut tell others said officer waving finger before nose smiling
delighted meet compatriot

frenchman russian prince incognito said officer looking pierre fine though dirty linen ring finger

frenchman never forgets either insult service
there much good nature nobility french sense word officer voice expression face gestures pierre unconsciously smiling response frenchman smile pressed hand held out 
captain ramballe 13th light regiment chevalier legion honor affair seventh september introduced himself self satisfied irrepressible smile puckering lips under mustache

when mutton omelet been served samovar vodka brought wine french taken from russian cellar brought ramballe invited pierre share dinner himself began eat greedily quickly like healthy hungry man munching food rapidly strong teeth continually smacking lips repeating excellent delicious face grew red covered perspiration

bare feet touched sleeping man stepped over opened door into part hut where prince andrew lay
dark there
farthest corner bench beside bed something lying stood tallow candle long thick smoldering wick

irresistible impulse drew forward
cautiously took one step another found herself middle small room containing baggage
another man tim khin lying corner benches beneath icons two others doctor valet lay floor
valet sat whispered something
tim khin kept awake pain wounded leg gazed wide open eyes strange apparition girl white chemise dressing jacket nightcap
valet sleepy frightened exclamation want matter made nat sha approach more swiftly lying corner
horribly unlike man body looked must see 
passed valet snuff fell from candle wick saw prince andrew clearly arms outside quilt such always seen 
same ever feverish color face glittering eyes rapturously turned toward especially neck delicate child revealed turn down collar shirt gave peculiarly innocent childlike look such never seen before
went swift flexible youthful movement dropped knees

prince andrew answered all questions reluctantly reasonably said wanted bolster placed under uncomfortable great pain
doctor valet lifted cloak covered making wry faces noisome smell mortifying flesh came from wound began examining dreadful place

first time prince andrew understood where matter remembered being wounded when asked carried into hut after cal che stopped myt shchi
after growing confused from pain being carried into hut again regained consciousness drinking tea once more recalled all happened above all vividly remembered moment ambulance station when sight sufferings man disliked those new thoughts come promised happiness
those thoughts though now vague indefinite again possessed soul
remembered now new source happiness happiness something gospels
why asked copy 
uncomfortable position put turned over again confused thoughts when came himself third time complete stillness night
everybody near sleeping
cricket chirped from across passage someone shouting singing street cockroaches rustled table icons walls big fly flopped head bed around candle beside wick charred shaped itself like mushroom
mind normal state
healthy man usually thinks feels remembers innumerable things simultaneously power will select one sequence thoughts events fix whole attention
healthy man can tear himself away from deepest reflections say civil word someone comes can return again own thoughts
prince andrew mind normal state respect
all powers mind more active clearer than ever acted apart from will
most diverse thoughts images occupied simultaneously
times brain suddenly began work vigor clearness depth never reached when health suddenly midst work would turn unexpected idea strength turn back again
yes new happiness revealed man cannot deprived thought lay semidarkness quiet hut gazing fixedly before feverish wide open eyes
happiness lying beyond material forces outside material influences act man happiness soul alone happiness loving
every man can understand conceive enjoin possible only god
did god enjoin law why son
suddenly sequence thoughts broke off prince andrew heard without knowing whether delusion reality soft whispering voice incessantly rhythmically repeating piti piti piti titi again piti piti piti once more
same time felt above face above very middle strange airy structure being erected out slender needles splinters sound whispered music
felt balance carefully though difficult airy structure should collapse nevertheless kept collapsing again slowly rising sound whispered rhythmic music stretches stretches spreading out stretching said prince andrew himself
listening whispering feeling sensation drawing out construction edifice needles also saw glimpses red halo round candle heard rustle cockroaches buzzing fly flopped against pillow face
each time fly touched face gave burning sensation yet surprise did destroy structure though knocked against very region face where rising
besides there something else importance
something white door statue sphinx also oppressed 
perhaps shirt table thought legs door why always stretching drawing itself out piti piti piti piti piti piti 
enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone
suddenly thoughts feelings again swam surface mind peculiar clearness force
yes love thought again quite clearly
love loves something quality purpose reason love dying first experienced when saw enemy yet loved 
experienced feeling love very essence soul does require object
now again feel bliss
love one neighbors love one enemies love everything love god all manifestations
possible lovesomeone dear human loveenemy can only loved divine love
why experienced such joy when felt loved man
become alive 
when loving human love one may pass from love hatred divine love cannot change
neither death nor anything else can destroy 
very essence soul
yet many people hated life all loved hated none did 
vividly pictured himself nat sha done past nothing charms gave delight first time picturing himself soul
understood feelings sufferings shame remorse
now understood first time all cruelty rejection cruelty rupture 
only possible see once more just once looking into those eyes say
piti piti piti piti piti piti boom flopped fly
attention suddenly carried into another world world reality delirium something particular happening
world structure still being erected did fall something still stretching out candle red halo still burning same shirtlike sphinx lay near doorbesides all something creaked there whiff fresh air new white sphinx appeared standing door
sphinx pale face shining eyes very nat sha whom just been thinking
oppressive continual delirium thought prince andrew trying drive face from imagination
face remained before force reality drew nearer
prince andrew wished return former world pure thought could delirium drew back into domain
soft whispering voice continued rhythmic murmur something oppressed stretched out strange face before 
prince andrew collected all strength effort recover senses moved little suddenly there ringing ears dimness eyes like man plunged into water lost consciousness
when came himself nat sha same living nat sha whom all people most longed love new pure divine love been revealed kneeling before 
realized real living nat sha surprised quietly happy
nat sha motionless knees unable stir frightened eyes riveted restraining sobs
only lower part something quivered
prince andrew sighed relief smiled held out hand
said
fortunate rapid careful movement nat sha drew nearer knees taking hand carefully bent face over began kissing just touching lightly lips
forgive whispered raising head glancing 
forgive love said prince andrew
forgive
forgive asked
forgive faltered nat sha scarcely audible broken whisper began kissing hand more rapidly just touching lips
love more better than before said prince andrew lifting face hand look into eyes
those eyes filled happy tears gazed timidly compassionately joyous love
nat sha thin pale face swollen lips more than plain dreadful
prince andrew did see saw shining eyes beautiful
heard sound voices behind 
peter valet now wide awake roused doctor
tim khin slept all pain leg long been watching all going carefully covering bare body sheet huddled bench
said doctor rising from bed
please away madam moment maid sent countess noticed daughter absence knocked door
like somnambulist aroused from sleep nat sha went out room returning hut fell sobbing bed
from time during all rest rost journey every halting place wherever spent night nat sha never left wounded bolk nski doctor admit expected from young girl either such firmness such skill nursing wounded man
dreadful countess imagined would should prince andrew die daughter arms during journey judging doctor said seemed might easily happen could oppose nat sha
though intimacy now established between wounded man nat sha thought occurred should recover their former engagement would renewed one least all nat sha prince andrew spoke unsettled question life death hung only over bolk nski over all russia shut out all other considerations
third september pierre awoke late

natural living those days imagine when half russia been conquered inhabitants fleeing distant provinces one levy after another being raised defense fatherland all russians from greatest least solely engaged sacrificing themselves saving their fatherland weeping over downfall
tales descriptions time without exception speak only self sacrifice patriotic devotion despair grief heroism russians
appears see only general historic interest time see all personal human interests people 
yet reality those personal interests moment much transcend general interests always prevent public interest from being felt even noticed
most people time paid attention general progress events guided only their private interests very people whose activities period most useful
those tried understand general course events take part self sacrifice heroism most useless members society saw everything upside down all did common good turned out useless foolish like pierre mam nov regiments looted russian villages lint young ladies prepared never reached wounded 
even those fond intellectual talk expressing their feelings discussed russia position time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either shade pretense falsehood useless condemnation anger directed against people accused actions one could possibly guilty 
historic events rule forbidding eat fruit tree knowledge specially applicable
only unconscious action bears fruit plays part historic event never understands significance
tries realize efforts are fruitless
more closely man engaged events taking place russia less did realize their significance
petersburg provinces distance from moscow ladies gentlemen militia uniforms wept russia ancient capital talked self sacrifice army retired beyond moscow there little talk thought moscow when caught sight burned ruins one swore avenged french thought about their next pay their next quarters matr shka vivandi like matters
war caught service nicholas rost took close prolonged part defense country did casually without aim self sacrifice therefore looked going russia without despair without dismally racking brains over 
been asked thought state russia would said business think about kut zov others there purpose heard regiments made their full strength fighting would probably long timeyet things being quite likely might command regiment couple years time
looked matter way learned being sent vor nezh buy remounts division only without regret being prevented from taking part coming battle greatest pleasure did conceal comrades fully understood
few days before battle borodin nicholas received necessary money warrants having sent hussars advance set out post horses vor nezh

nicholas remained silent
all same aunt impossible rejoined sigh after short pause
besides would princess besides now mourning

matchmaker are aunt
said nicholas kissing plump little hand
reaching moscow after meeting rost princess mary found nephew there tutor letter from prince andrew giving instructions get aunt malv ntseva vor nezh
feeling akin temptation tormented during father illness since death especially since meeting rost smothered arrangements journey anxiety about brother settling new house meeting new people attending nephew education
now after month passed quiet surroundings felt more more deeply loss father associated mind ruin russia
agitated incessantly tortured thought dangers brother only intimate person now remaining exposed
worried about nephew education always felt herself incompetent depths soul felt peace peace arising from consciousness having stifled those personal dreams hopes been point awakening within related meeting rost 
day after party governor wife came see malv ntseva after discussing plan aunt remarked though under present circumstances formal betrothal course thought all same young people might brought together could get know one another
malv ntseva expressed approval governor wife began speak rost mary presence praising telling blushed when princess mary name mentioned
princess mary experienced painful rather than joyful feeling mental tranquillity destroyed desires doubts self reproach hopes reawoke
during two days elapsed before rost called princess mary continually thought ought behave 
first decided come drawing room when called see aunt would proper deep mourning receive visitors thought would rude after done occurred aunt governor wife intentions concerning herself rost their looks words times seemed confirm supposition told herself only sinful nature could think could forget situated still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking would insult father memory
assuming did down see princess mary imagined words would say would say words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold mean much
more than anything feared lest confusion felt might overwhelm betray soon saw 
when sunday after church footman announced drawing room count rost called princess showed confusion only slight blush suffused cheeks eyes lit new radiant light
met aunt said calm voice unable herself understand could outwardly calm natural
when rost entered room princess dropped eyesinstant give visitor time greet aunt just nicholas turned raised head met look shining eyes
movement full dignity grace half rose smile pleasure held out slender delicate hand began speak voice first time new deep womanly notes vibrated
mademoiselle bourienne drawing room looked princess mary bewildered surprise
herself consummate coquette could maneuvered better meeting man wished attract
either black particularly becoming really greatly improved without having noticed 
above all tact grace thought mademoiselle bourienne
princess mary been capable reflection moment would been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne change taken place herself
from moment recognized dear loved face new life force took possession compelled speak act apart from own will
from time rost entered face became suddenly transformed
light been kindled carved painted lantern intricate skillful artistic work sides previously seemed dark coarse meaningless suddenly shown unexpected striking beauty
first time all pure spiritual inward travail through lived appeared surface
all inward labor dissatisfaction herself sufferings strivings after goodness meekness love self sacrifice all now shone those radiant eyes delicate smile every trait gentle face
rost saw all clearly known whole life
felt being before quite different from better than anyone met before above all better than himself
their conversation very simple unimportant
spoke war like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about spoke their last meeting nicholas trying change subject talked governor kind wife nicholas relations princess mary 
did talk about brother diverting conversation soon aunt mentioned andrew
evidently could speak russia misfortunes certain artificiality brother near heart neither could nor would speak lightly 
nicholas noticed noticed every shade princess mary character observation unusual everything confirmed conviction quite unusual extraordinary being
nicholas blushed confused when people spoke about princess did when mentioned even when thought presence felt quite ease said all prepared quite appropriately occurred moment
when pause occurred during short visit nicholas usual when there are children turned prince andrew little son caressing asking whether would like hussar
took boy knee played looked round princess mary
softened happy timid look watched boy lovedarms man loved
nicholas also noticed look understanding flushed pleasure began kiss boy good natured playfulness
mourning princess marydid out into society nicholas did think proper thing visit again all same governor wife went matchmaking passing nicholas flattering things princess marysaid vice versa insisting declaring himself princess mary
purpose arranged meeting between young people bishop house before mass
though rost told governor wife would make declaration princess mary promised 
tilsit rost allowed himself doubt everybody considered right right now after short sincere struggle between effort arrange life own sense justice obedient submission circumstances chose latter yielded power felt irresistibly carrying knew where
knew after promise nya would deemed base declare feelings princess mary
also knew rather felt bottom heart resigning himself now force circumstances those guiding only doing nothing wrong doing something very important more important than anything ever done life
after meeting princess mary though course life went externally before all former amusements lost their charm often thought about 
never thought about thought all young ladies without exception whom met society nor long time one time rapturously thought about nya
pictured each those young ladies almost all honest hearted young men possible wife adapting imagination all conditions married life white dressing gown wife tea table wife carriage little ones mamma papa their relations pictures future given pleasure
princess mary whom trying get engaged could never picture anything future married life
tried pictures seemed incongruous false
made afraid
dreadful news battle borodin our losses killed wounded still more terrible news loss moscow reached vor nezh middle september
princess mary having learned brother wound only from gazette having definite news prepared nicholas heard seen again himself set off search prince andrew
when received news battle borodin abandonment moscow rost seized despair anger desire vengeance feeling kind everything vor nezh suddenly seemed dull tiresome experienced indefinite feeling shame awkwardness
conversations heard seemed insincere did know judge all affairs felt only regiment would everything again become clear 
made haste finish buying horses often became unreasonably angry servant squadron quartermaster
few days before departure special thanksgiving nicholas present held cathedral russian victory
stood little behind governor held himself military decorum through service meditating great variety subjects
when service over governor wife beckoned 
seen princess asked indicating movement head lady standing opposite side beyond choir
nicholas immediately recognized princess mary much profile saw under bonnet feeling solicitude timidity pity immediately overcame 
princess mary evidently engrossed thoughts crossing herself last time before leaving church
nicholas looked face surprise
same face seen before there same general expression refined inner spiritual labor now quite differently lit 
there pathetic expression sorrow prayer hope 
occurred before when present nicholas went without waiting prompted governor wife asking himself whether right proper address church told heard trouble sympathized whole soul
soon heard voice vivid glow kindled face lighting both sorrow joy
there one thing wanted tell princess said rost 
your brother prince andrew nikol evich living would been once announced gazette colonel
princess looked grasping saying cheered expression regretful sympathy face
known many cases splinter wound gazette said shell either proving fatal once being very slight continued nicholas
must hope best sure
princess mary interrupted 
would dread
began prevented agitation from finishing bent head movement graceful everything did presence looking gratefully went out following aunt
evening nicholas did out stayed home settle accounts horse dealers
when finished business already late anywhere still early bed long time paced down room reflecting life thing rarely did
princess mary made agreeable impression when met smol nsk province
having encountered such exceptional circumstances mother having one time mentioned good match drawn particular attention 
when met again vor nezh impression made merely pleasing powerful
nicholas been struck peculiar moral beauty observed time
however preparing away entered head regret thus depriving himself chances meeting 
day encounter church felt sunk deeper than desirable peace mind
pale sad refined face radiant look those gentle graceful gestures especially deep tender sorrow expressed all features agitated evoked sympathy
men rost could bear see expression higher spiritual life why did like prince andrew referred contemptuously philosophy dreaminess princess mary very sorrow revealed depth whole spiritual world foreign irresistible attraction
must wonderful woman
why free why such hurry nya involuntarily compared two lack spirituality one abundance other spirituality himself lacked therefore valued most highly
tried picture would happen free
would propose would become wife
could imagine 
felt awed clear picture presented itself mind
long ago pictured himself future nya all clear simple just all been thought out knew all there nya impossible picture future princess mary did understand simply loved 
reveries about nya something merry playful dream princess mary always difficult little frightening
prayed thought
plain whole soul prayer
yes prayer moves mountains sure prayer will answered
why don pray want suddenly thought
want free released from nya
right thought remembering governor wife said nothing misfortune can come marrying nya
muddles grief mamma
muddles terrible muddles besides don love should
god release from dreadful inextricable position suddenly began pray
yes prayer can move mountains one must faith pray nat sha used children snow might turn into sugar run out into yard see whether done 
praying trifles now thought put pipe down corner folding hands placed himself before icon
softened memories princess mary began pray done long time
tears eyes throat when door opened lavr shka came papers
blockhead why come without being called cried nicholas quickly changing attitude
from governor said lavr shka sleepy voice
courier arrived there letter 
well all right thanks
can nicholas took two letters one from mother other from nya
recognized handwriting opened nya first
read only few lines when turned pale eyes opened wide fear joy
possible cried aloud
unable sit still paced down room holding letter reading 
glanced through read again again standing still middle room raised shoulders stretching out hands mouth wide open eyes fixed
just been praying confidence god would hear come pass nicholas much astonished something extraordinary unexpected very fact happened quickly proved come from god whom prayed ordinary coincidence
unexpected seemed nicholas quite voluntary letter from nya freed from knot fettered from there seemed escape
wrote last unfortunate events loss almost whole rost moscow property countess repeatedly expressed wish nicholas should marry princess bolk nskaya together silence coldness late all combined make decide release from promise set completely free
would painful think might cause sorrow discord family been good wrote love aim happiness those love nicholas beg consider yourself free assured spite everything one can love more than does your nya both letters written from itsa
other from countess described their last days moscow their departure fire destruction all their property
letter countess also mentioned prince andrew among wounded traveling state very critical doctor said there now more hope
nya nat sha nursing 
next day nicholas took mother letter went see princess mary
neither nor said word about nat sha nursing might mean thanks letter nicholas suddenly became almost intimate princess relations
following day saw princess mary off journey yarosl few days later left rejoin regiment
nya letter written from itsa come answer nicholas prayer prompted thought getting nicholas married heiress occupied old countess mind moremore
knew nya chief obstacle happening nya life countess house grown harder harder especially after received letter from nicholas telling meeting princess mary boguch rovo
countess let occasion slip making humiliating cruel allusions nya
few days before left moscow moved excited all going called nya instead reproaching making demands tearfully implored sacrifice herself repay all family done breaking off engagement nicholas
shall peace till promise 
nya burst into hysterical tears replied through sobs would anything prepared anything gave actual promise could bring herself decide demanded 
must sacrifice herself family reared brought 
sacrifice herself others nya habit
position house such only sacrifice could show worth accustomed loved doing 
all former acts self sacrifice been happily conscious raised own esteem others made more worthy nicholas whom loved more than anything world
now wanted sacrifice very thing constituted whole reward self sacrifice whole meaning life
first time felt bitterness against those been benefactors only torture more painfully felt jealous nat sha never experienced anything sort never needed sacrifice herself made others sacrifice themselves yet beloved everybody

officer soldiers arrested pierre treated hostility yet respect guardhouse taken
their attitude toward could still felt both uncertainty might perhaps very important person hostility result their recent personal conflict 
when guard relieved next morning pierre felt new guard both officers men interesting been captors fact guard second day did recognize big stout man peasant coat vigorous person fought desperately marauder convoy uttered those solemn words about saving child saw only 
captured russians arrested detained reason order higher command
noticed anything remarkable about pierre only unabashed meditative concentration thoughtfulness way spoke french struck surprisingly good
spite placed day other arrested suspects separate room occupied required officer
all russians confined pierre men lowest class recognizing gentleman all avoided more especially spoke french
pierre felt sad hearing making fun 
evening learned all prisoners probably among tried incendiarism
third day taken others house where french general white mustache sat two colonels other frenchmen scarves their arms
precision definiteness customary addressing prisoners supposed preclude human frailty pierre like others questioned where been object 
questions like questions put trials generally left essence matter aside shut out possibility essence being revealed designed only form channel through judges wished answers accused flow lead desired result namely conviction
soon pierre began say anything did fit aim channel removed water could flow waste
pierre felt moreover accused always feel their trial perplexity why questions put 
feeling only out condescension kind civility device placing channel employed
knew men power only force brought there force alone gave right demand answers their questions sole object assembly inculpate 
power wish inculpate expedient inquiry trial seemed unnecessary
evident answer would lead conviction
when asked doing when arrested pierre replied rather tragic manner restoring parents child saved from flames
why fought marauder pierre answered protecting woman protect woman being insulted duty every man 
interrupted point
why yard burning house where witnesses seen replied gone out see happening moscow
again interrupted asked where going why found near fire asked repeating their first question declined answer
put down bad
very bad sternly remarked general white mustache red flushed face
fourth day fires broke out bovski rampart
pierre thirteen others moved coach house merchant house near crimean bridge
way through streets pierre felt stifled smoke seemed hang over whole city
fires visible all sides
did realize significance burning moscow looked fires horror
passed four days coach house near crimean bridge during time learned from talk french soldiers all those confined there awaiting decision might come day from marshal
marshal pierre could learn from soldiers
evidently marshal represented very high rather mysterious power
first days before eighth september when prisoners second examination hardest all pierre
eighth september officer very important one judging respect guards showed entered coach house where prisoners 
officer probably someone staff holding paper hand called over all russians there naming pierre man does give name
glancing indolently indifferently all prisoners ordered officer charge decently dressed tidied before taking marshal
hour later squad soldiers arrived pierre thirteen others led virgin field
fine day sunny after rain air unusually pure
smoke did hang low day when pierre been taken from guardhouse bovski rampart rose through pure air columns
flames seen columns smoke rose all sides all moscow far pierre could see one vast charred ruin
all sides there waste spaces only stoves chimney stacks still standing there blackened walls brick houses
pierre gazed ruins did recognize districts known well
there could see churches been burned
mlin destroyed gleamed white distance towers belfry great
domes new convent virgin glittered brightly bells ringing particularly clearly
bells reminded pierre sunday feast nativity virgin
there seemed one celebrate holiday everywhere blackened ruins few russians seen tattered frightened people tried hide when saw french
plain russian nestruined destroyed place russian order life been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt quite different firm french order been established over ruined nest
felt looks soldiers marching regular ranks briskly gaily escorting other criminals felt looks important french official carriage pair driven soldier whom met way
felt merry sounds regimental music heard from left side field felt realized especially from list prisoners french officer read out when came morning
pierre been taken one set soldiers led first one another place dozens other men seemed might forgotten confused others
answers given when questioned come back designation man does give name under appellation pierre seemed terrible now leading somewhere unhesitating assurance their faces all other prisoners exactly ones wanted being taken proper place
pierre felt himself insignificant chip fallen among wheels machine whose action did understand working well
other prisoners taken right side virgin field large white house immense garden far from convent
prince shcherb tov house where pierre often been other days learned from talk soldiers now occupied marshal duke eckm davout 
taken entrance led into house oneone
pierre sixth enter
conducted through glass gallery anteroom hall familiar into long low study door stood adjutant
davout spectacles nose sat bent over table further end room
pierre went close davout evidently consulting paper lay before did look 
without raising eyes said low voice are pierre silent incapable uttering word
davout merely french general man notorious cruelty
looking cold face sat like stern schoolmaster prepared wait awhile answer pierre felt every instant delay might cost life did know say
did venture repeat said first examination yet disclose rank position dangerous embarrassing
silent
before decided davout raised head pushed spectacles back forehead screwed eyes looked intently 
know man said cold measured tone evidently calculated frighten pierre
chill been running down pierre back now seized head vise
cannot know general never seen 
russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general present whom pierre noticed
davout turned away
unexpected reverberation voice pierre rapidly began monseigneur said suddenly remembering davout duke
monseigneur cannot known 
militia officer quitted moscow
your name asked davout
bez khov
proof are lying monseigneur exclaimed pierre offended pleading voice
davout looked gazed intently 
seconds looked one another look saved pierre
apart from conditions war law look established human relations between two men
moment immense number things passed dimly through both their minds realized both children humanity brothers
first glance when davout only raised head from papers where human affairs lives indicated numbers pierre merely circumstance davout could shot without burdening conscience evil deed now saw human being
reflected moment
can show are telling truth said davout coldly
pierre remembered ramballe named regiment street where house 
are say returned davout
trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs truth statements
moment adjutant entered reported something davout
davout brightened news adjutant brought began buttoning uniform
when adjutant reminded prisoner jerked head pierre direction frown ordered led away
where take pierre did know back coach house place execution companions pointed out crossed virgin field
turned head saw adjutant putting another question davout
yes course replied davout yes meant pierre did know
pierre could afterwards remember went whether far direction
faculties quite numbed stupefied noticing nothing around went moving legs others did till all stopped stopped 
only thought mind time really sentenced death men commission first examined one wished evidently could done 
davout looked human way
another moment davout would realized doing wrong just adjutant come interrupted 
adjutant also evidently evil intent though might refrained from coming 
executing killing depriving life pierre all memories aspirations hopes thoughts doing pierre felt one
system concurrence circumstances
system sort killing pierre depriving life everything annihilating 
from prince shcherb tov house prisoners led straight down virgin field left nunnery far kitchen garden post been set 
beyond post fresh pit been dug ground near post pit large crowd stood semicircle
crowd consisted few russians many napoleon soldiers duty germans italians frenchmen variety uniforms
right left post stood rows french troops blue uniforms red epaulets high boots shakos
prisoners placed certain order according list pierre sixth led post
several drums suddenly began beat both sides sound pierre felt part soul been torn away
lost power thinking understanding
only one wish frightful thing happen should happen quickly
pierre looked round fellow prisoners scrutinized 
two first convicts shaven heads
one tall thin other dark shaggy sinewy flat nose
third domestic serf about forty five years old grizzled hair plump well nourished body
fourth peasant very handsome man broad light brown beard black eyes
fifth factory hand thin sallow faced lad eighteen loose coat
pierre heard french consulting whether shoot separately two time
couples replied officer command calm voice
there stir ranks soldiers evident all hurrying men hurry something understand people hurry finish necessary unpleasant incomprehensible task
frenchofficial wearing scarf came right row prisoners read out sentence russian french
two pairs frenchmen approached criminals officer command took two convicts stood first row
convicts stopped when reached post sacks being brought looked dumbly around wounded beast looks approaching huntsman
one crossed himself continually other scratched back made movement lips resembling smile
hurried hands soldiers blindfolded drawing sacks over their heads bound post
twelve sharpshooters muskets stepped out ranks firm regular tread halted eight paces from post
pierre turned away avoid seeing going happen
suddenly crackling rolling noise heard seemed louder than most terrific thunder looked round
there smoke frenchmen doing something near pit pale faces trembling hands
two more prisoners led 
same way similar looks two glanced vainly onlookers only silent appeal protection their eyes evidently unable understand believe going happen 
could believe alone knew their life meant neither understood nor believed could taken from 
again pierre did wish look again turned away again sound frightful explosion struck ear same moment saw smoke blood pale scared faces frenchmen again doing something post their trembling hands impeding one another
pierre breathing heavily looked around asking meant
same question expressed all looks met 
faces all russians french soldiers officers without exception read same dismay horror conflict own heart
after all doing are all suffering 
flashed instant through mind
sharpshooters 86th forward shouted someone
fifth prisoner one next pierre led away alone
pierre did understand saved rest been brought there only witness execution
ever growing horror sense joy relief gazed taking place
fifth man factory lad loose cloak
moment laid hands sprang aside terror clutched pierre
pierre shuddered shook himself free
dragged along holding under arms screamed
when got post grew quiet suddenly understood something
whether understood screaming useless whether thought incredible men should kill rate took stand post waiting blindfolded like others like wounded animal looked around glittering eyes
pierre longer able turn away close eyes
curiosity agitation like whole crowd reached highest pitch fifth murder
like others fifth man seemed calm wrapped loose cloak closer rubbed one bare foot other
when began blindfold himself adjusted knot hurt back head when propped against bloodstained post leaned back being comfortable position straightened himself adjusted feet leaned back again more comfortably
pierre did take eyes from did miss slightest movement
probably word command given followed reports eight muskets try would pierre could afterwards remember having heard slightest sound shots
only saw workman suddenly sank down cords held blood showed itself two places ropes slackened under weight hanging body workman sat down head hanging unnaturally one leg bent under 
pale frightened people doing something around workman
lower jaw old frenchman thick mustache trembled untied ropes
soldiers dragged awkwardly from post began pushing into pit
all plainly certainly knew criminals must hide traces their guilt quickly possible
pierre glanced into pit saw factory lad lying knees close head one shoulder higher than other
shoulder rose fell rhythmically convulsively spadefuls earth already being thrown over whole body
one soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly angrily pierre back
pierre did understand remained near post one drove away
when pit been filled command given
pierre taken back place rows troops both sides post made half turn went past measured pace
twenty four sharpshooters discharged muskets standing center circle ran back their places companies passed 
pierre gazed now dazed eyes sharpshooters ran couples out circle
one young soldier face deadly pale shako pushed back musket resting ground still stood near pit spot from fired
swayed like drunken man taking steps forward back save himself from falling
old noncommissioned officer ran out ranks taking elbow dragged company
crowd russians frenchmen began disperse
all went away silently drooping heads
will teach start fires said one frenchmen
pierre glanced round speaker saw soldier trying find relief after been done able 
without finishing begun say made hopeless movement arm went away
after execution pierre separated from rest prisoners placed alone small ruined befouled church
toward evening noncommissioned officer entered two soldiers told been pardoned would now barracks prisoners war
without understanding said pierre got went soldiers
took upper end field where there sheds built charred planks beams battens led into one 
darkness twenty different men surrounded pierre
looked without understanding why there wanted 
heard said did understand meaning words made kind deduction from application 
replied questions put did consider listening replies nor would understand 
looked their faces figures all seemed equally meaningless
from moment pierre witnessed those terrible murders committed men did wish commit mainspring life everything depended made everything appear alive suddenly been wrenched out everything collapsed into heap meaningless rubbish
though did acknowledge himself faith right ordering universe humanity own soul god been destroyed
experienced before never strongly now
when similar doubts assailed before been result own wrongdoing bottom heart felt relief from despair from those doubts found within himself
now felt universe crumbled before eyes only meaningless ruins remained fault own
felt power regain faith meaning life
around darkness men standing evidently something about interested greatly
telling somethingasking something
led away somewhere last found himself corner shed among men laughing talking all sides
well mates
voice other end shed saying strong emphasis word 
sitting silent motionless heap straw against wall pierre sometimes opened sometimes closed eyes
soon closed saw before dreadful face factory lad especially dreadful simplicity faces murderers even more dreadful their disquiet
opened eyes again stared vacantly into darkness around 
beside stooping position sat small man whose presence first made aware strong smell perspiration came from every time moved
man doing something legs darkness though pierre could see face felt man continually glanced 
growing used darkness pierre saw man taking off leg bands way did aroused pierre interest
having unwound string tied band one leg carefully coiled immediately set work other leg glancing pierre
one hand hung first string other already unwinding band second leg
way having carefully removed leg bands deft circular motions arm following one another uninterruptedly man hung leg bands pegs fixed above head
took out knife cut something closed knife placed under head bed seating himself comfortably clasped arms round lifted knees fixed eyes pierre
latter conscious something pleasant comforting well rounded deft movements man well ordered arrangements corner even very smell looked man without taking eyes from 
seen lot trouble sir little man suddenly said
there much kindliness simplicity singsong voice pierre tried reply jaw trembled felt tears rising eyes

dear fellow

plat shifted seat straw
after short silence rose
well think must sleepy said began rapidly crossing himself repeating lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola lavra lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola lavra lord jesus christ mercy save concluded bowed ground got sighed sat down again heap straw
lay down like stone god raise like loaf muttered lay down pulling coat over 
prayer saying asked pierre
murmured plat almost fallen asleep
saying praying
don pray yes said pierre
said frola lavra well course replied plat quickly horses saints
one must pity animals 
rascal now curled got warm daughter bitch said karat touching dog lay feet again turning over fell asleep immediately
sounds crying screaming came from somewhere distance outside flames visible through cracks shed inside quiet dark
long time pierre did sleep lay eyes open darkness listening regular snoring plat lay beside felt world been shattered once more stirring soul new beauty new unshakable foundations
twenty three soldiers three officers two officials confined shed pierre been placed where remained four weeks
when pierre remembered afterwards all seemed misty figures except plat karat always remained mind most vivid precious memory personification everything russian kindly round
when pierre saw neighbor next morning dawn first impression something roundfully confirmed plat whole figure french overcoat girdled cord soldier cap bast shoes round
head quite roundback chest shoulders even arms held ever ready embrace something rounded pleasant smile large gentle brown eyes also round
plat karat must been fifty judging stories campaigns been told old soldier
did himself know age quite unable determine 
brilliantly white strong teeth showed two unbroken semicircles when laughed often did all sound good there gray hair beard head whole body gave impression suppleness especially firmness endurance
face despite fine rounded wrinkles expression innocence youth voice pleasant musical
chief peculiarity speech directness appositeness
evident never considered said going say consequently rapidity justice intonation irresistible persuasiveness
physical strength agility during first days imprisonment such seemed know fatigue sickness meant
every night before lying down said lord lay down stone raise loaf every morning getting said lay down curled get shake myself
indeed only lie down fall asleep like stone only shake himself ready without moment delay work just children are ready play directly awake
could everything very well badly
baked cooked sewed planed mended boots
always busy only night allowed himself conversation fond songs
did sing like trained singer knows listened like birds evidently giving vent sounds same way one stretches oneself walks about get rid stiffness sounds always high pitched mournful delicate almost feminine face such times very serious
having been taken prisoner allowed beard grow seemed thrown off all been forced upon everything military alien himself returned former peasant habits
soldier leave shirt outside breeches would say
did like talking about life soldier though did complain often mentioned been flogged once during whole army service
when related anything generally old evidently precious memory christian life called peasant existence
proverbs talk full most part coarse indecent saws soldiers employ those folk sayings taken without context seem insignificant when used appositely suddenly acquire significance profound wisdom
would often say exact opposite said previous occasion yet both would right
liked talk talked well adorning speech terms endearment folk sayings pierre thought invented himself chief charm talk lay fact commonest events sometimes just such pierre witnessed without taking notice assumed karat character solemn fitness
liked hear folk tales one soldiers used tell evening always same most all liked hear stories real life
would smile joyfully when listening such stories now putting word asking question make moral beauty told clear himself
karat attachments friendships love pierre understood loved lived affectionately everything life brought contact particularly man particular man those whom happened 
loved dog comrades french pierre neighbor pierre felt spite karat affectionate tenderness unconsciously gave pierre spiritual life due would grieved moment parting from 
pierre began feel same way toward karat 
all other prisoners plat karat seemed most ordinary soldier
called little falcon plat sha chaffed good naturedly sent errands
pierre always remained seemed first night unfathomable rounded eternal personification spirit simplicity truth
plat karat knew nothing heart except prayers
when began speak seemed know would conclude
sometimes pierre struck meaning words would ask repeat plat could never recall said moment before just never could repeat pierre words favorite song native birch tree heart sick occurred when spoken sung meaning could got out 
did could understand meaning words apart from their context
every word action manifestation activity unknown life
life regarded meaning separate thing
meaning only part whole always conscious
words actions flowed from evenly inevitably spontaneously fragrance exhales from flower
could understand value significance word deed taken separately
when princess mary heard from nicholas brother rost yarosl once prepared there spite aunt efforts dissuade merely herself take nephew

after day lived through many things gaining knowledge observation experience possessed all faculties afterwards acquired could better more profound understanding meaning scene witnessed between father mary nat sha than 
understood completely leaving room without crying went silently nat sha come out looked shyly beautiful thoughtful eyes uplifted rosy upper lip trembled leaning head against began cry
after avoided dessalles countess caressed either sat alone came timidly princess mary nat sha whom seemed even fonder than aunt clung quietly shyly
when princess mary left prince andrew fully understood nat sha face told 
did speak more nat sha hopes saving life
took turns beside sofa did cry more prayed continually turning soul eternal unfathomable whose presence above dying man now evident
only did prince andrew know would die felt dying already half dead
conscious aloofness from everything earthly strange joyous lightness existence
without haste agitation awaited coming
inexorable eternal distant unknown presence felt continually all life now near strange lightness experienced almost comprehensible palpable
formerly feared end
twice experienced terribly tormenting feardeath end now longer understood fear
felt first time when shell spun like top before looked fallow field bushes sky knew face face death
when came himself after being wounded flower eternal unfettered love instantly unfolded itself soul freed from bondage life restrained longer feared death ceased think about 
during hours solitude suffering partial delirium spent after wounded more deeply penetrated into new principle eternal love revealed more unconsciously detached himself from earthly life
love everything everybody always sacrifice oneself love meant love anyone live earthly life
more imbued became principle love more renounced life more completely destroyed dreadful barrier absence such love stands between life death
when during those first days remembered would die said himself well much better after night myt shchi when half delirious seen whom longed appear before having pressed hand lips shed gentle happy tears love particular woman again crept unobserved into heart once more bound life
joyful agitating thoughts began occupy mind
recalling moment ambulance station when seen kur gin could now regain feeling tormented question whether kur gin alive
illness pursued normal physical course nat sha referred when said suddenly happened occurred two days before princess mary arrived
last spiritual struggle between life death death gained victory
unexpected realization fact still valued life presented form love nat sha last though ultimately vanquished attack terror before unknown
evening
usual after dinner slightly feverish thoughts preternaturally clear
began doze
come thought 
nya place sat nat sha just come noiselessly
since begun looking after always experienced physical consciousness nearness
sitting armchair placed sideways screening light candle from knitting stocking
learned knit stockingssince prince andrew casually mentioned one nursed sick well old nurses knit stockingsthere something soothing knitting stockings
needles clicked lightly slender rapidly moving hands could clearly see thoughtful profile drooping face
moved ball rolled off knees
started glanced round screening candle hand stooped carefully supple exact movement picked ball regained former position
looked without moving saw wanted draw deep breath after stooping refrained from doing breathed cautiously
itsa monastery spoken past told lived would always thank god wound brought together again after never spoke future
can can now thought looked listened light click steel needles
can fate brought strangely only die 
possible truth life been revealed only show spent life falsity love more than anything world love thought involuntarily groaned from habit acquired during sufferings
hearing sound nat sha put down stocking leaned nearer suddenly noticing shining eyes stepped lightly bent over 
are asleep been looking long time
one else gives sense soft tranquillity 
want weep joy
nat sha drew closer 
nat sha love much more than anything world
turned away instant
why much 
well feel your soul your whole soul shall live think sure sure nat sha almost shouted taking hold both hands passionate movement
remained silent awhile
good would taking hand kissed 
nat sha felt happy agitated once remembered would quiet
slept said repressing joy
please pressed hand released went back candle sat down again former position
twice turned looked eyes met beaming 
set herself task stocking resolved turn round till finished
soon really shut eyes fell asleep
did sleep long suddenly awoke start cold perspiration
fell asleep still been thinking subject now always occupied mind about life deathchiefly about death
love love thought
love hinders death
all everything understand understand only love
everything everything exists only love
love god die means particle love shall return general eternal source
only thoughts
something lacking clear one sidedly personal brain spun
there former agitation obscurity
dreamed lying room really quite well unwounded
many various indifferent insignificant people appeared before 
talked discussed something trivial
prince andrew dimly realized all trivial more important cares continued speak surprising empty witticisms
gradually unnoticed all persons began disappear single question closed door superseded all else
rose went door bolt lock 
everything depended whether time lock 
went tried hurry legs refused move knew would time lock door though painfully strained all powers
fear fear death
just when clumsily creeping toward door dreadful something other side already pressing against forcing way 
something human death breaking through door kept out
seized door making final effort hold back lock longer possible efforts weak clumsy door pushed from behind terror opened closed again
once again pushed from outside
last superhuman efforts vain both halves door noiselessly opened
entered death prince andrew died
instant died prince andrew remembered asleep very instant died having made effort awoke
yes death died woke 
yes death awakening all once grew light soul veil till concealed unknown lifted from spiritual vision
felt powers till confined within been liberated strange lightness did again leave 
when waking cold perspiration moved divan nat sha went asked matter
did answer looked strangely understanding
happened two days before princess mary arrival
from day doctor expressed wasting fever assumed malignant character doctor said did interest nat sha saw terrible moral symptoms more convincing
from day awakening from life came prince andrew together awakening from sleep
compared duration life did seem slower than awakening from sleep compared duration dream
there nothing terrible violent comparatively slow awakening
last days hours passed ordinary simple way
both princess mary nat sha did leave felt 
did weep shudder during last days themselves felt attending longer there left reminded most closely body
both felt strongly outward terrible side death did affect did feel necessary foment their grief
neither presence nor out did weep nor did ever talk one another about 
felt could express words understood
both saw sinking slowly quietly deeper deeper away from both knew right
confessed received communion everyone came take leave 
when brought son pressed lips boy turned away felt hard sad princess mary nat sha understood simply thought all required when told bless boy did demanded looked round asking whether there anything else should 
when last convulsions body spirit leaving occurred princess mary nat sha present
over said princess mary when body few minutes lain motionless growing cold before 
nat sha went looked dead eyes hastened close 
closed did kiss clung reminded most nearly body
where gone where now 
when body washed dressed lay coffin table everyone came take leave all wept
little nicholas cried heart rent painful perplexity
countess nya cried from pity nat sha more
old count cried felt before long must take same terrible step
nat sha princess mary also wept now their own personal grief wept reverent softening emotion taken possession their souls consciousness simple solemn mystery death been accomplished their presence

historians consider next battle borodin occupation moscow enemy destruction fire most important episode war 1812 movement russian army from ryaz kal road tar tino camp called flank march across snaya pakhr river
ascribe glory achievement genius different men dispute whom honor due
even foreign historians including french acknowledge genius russian commanders when speak flank march
hard understand why military writers following others consider flank march profound conception one man saved russia destroyed napoleon
first place hard understand where profundity genius movement lay much mental effort needed see best position army when being attacked where there are most provisions even dull boy thirteen could guessed best position army after retreat from moscow 1812 kal road
impossible understand reasoning historians reach conclusion maneuver profound one
even more difficult understand just why think maneuver calculated save russia destroy frenchflank march been preceded accompanied followed other circumstances might proved ruinous russians salutary french
position russian army really began improve from time march does all follow march cause 
flank march might only failed give advantage russian army might other circumstances led destruction
would happened moscow burned down murat lost sight russians napoleon remained inactive russian army snaya pakhr given battle bennigsen barclay advised would happened french attacked russians marching beyond pakhr would happened approaching tar tino napoleon attacked russians tenth energy shown when attacked smol nsk would happened french moved petersburg 
eventualities flank march brought salvation might proved disastrous
third most incomprehensible thing people studying history deliberately avoid seeing flank march cannot attributed one man one ever foresaw reality like retreat from fil did suggest itself anyone entirety resulted moment moment step step event event from endless number most diverse circumstances only seen entirety when been accomplished belonged past
council fil prevailing thought minds russian commanders one naturally suggesting itself namely direct retreat zhni road
proof there fact majority council voted such retreat above all there well known conversation after council between commander chief lansk charge commissariat department
lansk informed commander chief army supplies most part stored along ryaz provinces retreated zhni army would separated from supplies broad river cannot crossed early winter
first indication necessity deviating from previously seemed most natural course direct retreat zhni vgorod
army turned more south along ryaz road nearer supplies
subsequently inactivity french even lost sight russian army concern safety arsenal especially advantages drawing nearer supplies caused army turn still further south road
having crossed over forced march road beyond pakhr russian commanders intended remain pod lsk thought tar tino position innumerable circumstances reappearance french troops time lost touch russians projects giving battle above all abundance provisions kal province obliged our army turn still more south cross from kal road tar tino between roads along those supplies lay
just impossible say when decided abandon moscow impossible say precisely when whom decided move tar tino
only when army got there resultinnumerable varying forces did people begin assure themselves desired movement long ago foreseen result
famous flank movement merely consisted after advance french ceased russian army been continually retreating straight back from invaders deviated from direct course finding itself pursued naturally drawn toward district where supplies abundant
instead imagining ourselves commanders genius leading russian army picture army without leaders could done anything make return movement toward moscow describing arc direction where most provisions found where country richest
movement from zhni ryaz kal roads natural even russian marauders moved direction demands sent from petersburg kut zov take army way
tar tino kut zov received almost reprimand from emperor having moved army along ryaz road emperor letter indicated very position already occupied near kal 
having rolled like ball direction impetus given whole campaign battle borodin russian army when strength impetus exhausted fresh push received assumed position natural 
kut zov merit lay strategic maneuver genius called fact alone understood significance happened
alone understood meaning french army inactivity alone continued assert battle borodin been victory alone commander chief might been expected eager attack employed whole strength restrain russian army from useless engagements
beast wounded borodin lying where fleeing hunter left whether still alive whether strong merely lying low hunter did know
moan wounded beast french army betrayed calamitous condition sending lauriston kut zov camp overtures peace
napoleon usual assurance whatever entered head right wrote kut zov first words occurred though meaningless
monsieur prince koutouzov sending one adjutants general discuss several interesting questions 
beg your highness credit says especially when expresses sentiment esteem special regard long entertained your person
letter having other object pray god monsieur prince koutouzov keep holy gracious protection napoleon moscow october 1812 kut zov replied should cursed posterity looked initiator settlement sort
such present spirit nation
continued exert all powers restrain troops from attacking
during month french troops pillaging moscow russian troops quietly encamped tar tino change taken place relative strength two armies both spirit number result superiority passed russian side
though condition numbers french army unknown russians soon change occurred need attacking once showed itself countless signs
signs lauriston mission abundance provisions tar tino reports coming from all sides inactivity disorder french flow recruits our regiments fine weather long rest russian soldiers enjoyed impatience been assembled usually shows itself army been resting curiosity french army long lost sight doing boldness our outposts now scouted close french stationed tar tino news easy successes gained peasants guerrilla troops over french envy aroused desire revenge lay heart every russian long french moscow above all dim consciousness every soldier mind relative strength armies changed advantage now our side
there substantial change relative strength advance become inevitable
once clock begins strike chime soon minute hand completed full circle change shown increased activity whirring chiming higher spheres
russian army commanded kut zov staff also emperor from petersburg
before news abandonment moscow been received petersburg detailed plan whole campaign been drawn sent kut zov guidance
though plan been drawn supposition moscow still our hands approved staff accepted basis action
kut zov only replied movements arranged from distance always difficult execute
fresh instructions sent solution difficulties might encountered well fresh people watch kut zov actions report upon 
besides whole staff russian army now reorganized
posts left vacant bagrati been killed barclay gone away dudgeon filled
very serious consideration given question whether would better put place contrary put place anything more than satisfaction depended 
result hostility between kut zov bennigsen chief staff presence confidential representatives emperor transfers more than usually complicated play parties going among staff army
undermining undermining all possible combinations permutations
all plottings subject intrigue generally conduct war all men believed directing affair war went independently never way people devised flowing always from essential attitude masses
only highest spheres did all schemes crossings interminglings appear true reflection happen
prince michael ilari novich wrote emperor second october letter reached kut zov after battle tar tino since september moscow been hands enemy
your last reports written twentieth during all time only action been taken against enemy relief ancient capital according your last report even retreated farther
rpukhov already occupied enemy detachment famous arsenal indispensable army danger
from general wintzingerode reports see enemy corps ten thousand men moving petersburg road
another corps several thousand men moving trov
third advanced along vlad mir road fourth rather considerable detachment stationed between mozh ysk
napoleon himself moscow late twenty fifth
view all information when enemy scattered forces large detachments napoleon guards moscow possible enemy forces confronting are considerable allow your taking offensive contrary probably pursuing detachments most army corps much weaker than army entrusted 
would seem availing yourself circumstances might advantageously attack weaker one annihilate least oblige retreat retaining our hands important part provinces now occupied enemy thereby averting danger from other towns interior
will responsible enemy able direct force size against petersburg threaten capital been possible retain many troops army entrusted acting resolution energy ample means avert fresh calamity
remember still answer our offended country loss moscow
readiness will weaken russia right expect from all zeal firmness success your intellect military talent courage troops command justify expecting
time letter proved real relation forces already made itself felt petersburg dispatched kut zov found himself unable longer restrain army commanded from attacking battle taken place
second october cossack shapov lov out scouting killed one hare wounded another
following wounded hare made way far into forest came upon left flank murat army encamped there without precautions
cossack laughingly told comrades almost fallen into hands french
cornet hearing story informed commander
cossack sent questioned
cossack officers wished take advantage chance capture horses one superior officers acquainted higher authorities reported incident general staff
state things staff late been exceedingly strained
erm lov been see bennigsen few days previously entreated use influence commander chief induce take offensive
did know should think did want are asking 
need only advise anything highness sure opposite replied bennigsen
cossack report confirmed horse patrols sent out final proof events matured
tightly coiled spring released clock began whirr chimes play
despite all supposed power intellect experience knowledge men kut zov having taken into consideration cossack report note from bennigsen sent personal reports emperor wishes supposed emperor hold factall generals expressed same wish could longer check inevitable movement gave order regarded useless harmful gave approval accomplished fact
bennigsen note cossack information left flank french unguarded merely final indications necessary order attack fixed fifth october
morning fourth october kut zov signed dispositions
toll read erm lov asking attend further arrangements
all rightall right
haven time just now replied erm lov left hut
dispositions drawn toll very good
austerlitz dispositions written though german time first column will march second column will march there there paper all columns arrived their places appointed time destroyed enemy
everything been admirably thought out usual dispositions always case single column reached place appointed time
when necessary number copies dispositions been prepared officer summoned sent deliver erm lov deal 
young officer horse guards kut zov orderly pleased importance mission entrusted went erm lov quarters
gone away said erm lov orderly
officer horse guards went general whom erm lov often found
general out 
officer mounting horse rode off someone else
gone out
only don make responsible delay nuisance thought officer rode round whole camp
one man said seen erm lov ride past other generals others said must returned home
officer searched till six clock evening without even stopping eat
erm lov nowhere found one knew where 
officer snatched little food comrade rode again vanguard find milor dovich
milor dovich away told gone ball general kin erm lov probably there 
where why there over chkino said cossack officer pointing country house far distance
outside our line put two regiments outposts having such spree there awful two bands three sets singers officer rode out beyond our lines chkino
still distance heard rode merry sounds soldier dance song proceeding from house
meadows
meadows heard accompanied whistling sound torban drowned every now shouts
sounds made spirits rise same time afraid would blamed having executed sooner important order entrusted 
dismounted went into porch large country house remained intact between russian french forces
refreshment room hall footmen bustling about wine viands
groups singers stood outside windows
officer admitted immediately saw all chief generals army together among erm lov big imposing figure
all their coats unbuttoned standing semicircle flushed animated faces laughing loudly
middle room short handsome general red face dancing trep much spirit agility
bravo nicholas nych officer felt arriving important orders such moment doubly blame would preferred wait one generals espied hearing come about informed erm lov
erm lov came forward frown face hearing officer say took papers from without word
think went off just chance said comrade staff evening officer horse guards referring erm lov
done purpose get konovn tsyn into trouble
see mess there tomorrow
next day decrepit kut zov having given orders called early said prayers dressed unpleasant consciousness having direct battle did approve got into cal che drove from letash vka village three half miles from tar tino place where attacking columns meet
sat cal che dozing waking turns listening sound firing right indication action begun
all still quiet
approaching tar tino kut zov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses water across road along driving
kut zov looked searchingly stopped carriage inquired regiment belonged 
belonged column should been far front ambush long before 
may mistake thought old commander chief
little further saw infantry regiments their arms piled soldiers only partly dressed eating their rye porridge carrying fuel
officer reported order advance been received
rec
kut zov began checked himself immediately sent senior officer
getting out cal che waited drooping head breathing heavily pacing silently down
when khen officer general staff whom summoned appeared kut zov went purple face officer blame mistake object sufficient importance vent wrath 
trembling panting old man fell into state fury sometimes used roll ground fell upon khen threatening hands shouting loading gross abuse
another man captain zin happened turn all blame suffered same fate
sort another blackguard are shot scoundrels yelled kut zov hoarse voice waving arms reeling
suffering physically
commander chief serene highness everybody said possessed powers such man ever russia placed position made laughingstock whole army needn been such hurry pray about today kept awake thinking everything over all night thought himself
when chit officer one would dared mock 
now state physical suffering from corporal punishment could avoid expressing cries anger distress
strength soon began fail looking about conscious having said much amiss again got into cal che drove back silence
wrath once expended did return blinking feebly listened excuses self justifications erm lov did come see till next dayinsistence bennigsen konovn tsyn toll movement miscarried should executed next day
once more kut zov consent
next day troops assembled their appointed places evening advanced during night
autumn night dark purple clouds rain
ground damp muddy troops advanced noiselessly only occasionally jingling artillery could faintly heard
men forbidden talk out loud smoke their pipes strike light tried prevent their horses neighing
secrecy undertaking heightened charm marched gaily
columns supposing reached their destination halted piled arms settled down cold ground majority marched all night arrived places where evidently should been
only count orl den sov cossacks least important detachment all got appointed place right time
detachment halted outskirts forest path leading from village strom lova trovsk
toward dawn count orl den sov dozed off awakened deserter from french army being brought 
polish sergeant poniatowski corps explained polish come over been slighted service ought long ago been made officer braver than left wished pay out
said murat spending night less than mile from where would let convoy hundred men would capture alive
count orl den sov consulted fellow officers
offer tempting refused
everyone volunteered everybody advised making attempt
after much disputing arguing major general kov two cossack regiments decided polish sergeant
now remember said count orl den sov sergeant parting been lying hanged like dog true shall hundred gold pieces without replying sergeant resolute air mounted rode away kov whose men quickly assembled
disappeared into forest count orl den sov having seen kov off returned shivering from freshness early dawn excited undertaken own responsibility began looking enemy camp now just visible deceptive light dawn dying campfires
our columns ought begun appear open declivity right
looked direction though columns would been visible quite far off seen
seemed count things beginning stir french camp keen sighted adjutant confirmed 
really late said count orl looking camp
often happens when someone trusted longer before our eyes suddenly seemed quite clear obvious sergeant impostor lied whole russian attack would ruined absence those two regiments would lead away heaven only knew where
could one capture commander chief from among such mass troops sure rascal lying said count
can still called back said one suite like count orl felt distrustful adventure when looked enemy camp
really
think should let will fetched back fetch back fetch back said count orl sudden determination looking watch
quite light
adjutant galloped through forest after kov
when kov returned count orl den sov excited both abandoned attempt vainly awaiting infantry columns still did appear well proximity enemy resolved advance
all men felt same excitement
mount commanded whisper
men took their places crossed themselves
forward god aid hurrah reverberated forest cossack companies trailing their lances advancing one after another poured out sack dashed gaily across brook toward camp
one desperate frightened yell from first french soldier saw cossacks all camp undressed only just waking ran off all directions abandoning cannons muskets horses
cossacks pursued french without heeding behind around would captured murat everything there
officers desired
impossible make cossacks budge when once got booty prisoners
none listened orders
fifteen hundred prisoners thirty eight guns taken spot besides standards seemed most important cossacks horses saddles horsecloths like
all dealt prisoners guns secured booty divided without shouting even little fighting among themselvescossacks all busied themselves
french being farther pursued began recover themselves formed into detachments began firing
orl den sov still waiting other columns arrive advanced further
meantime according dispositions said first column will march infantry belated columns commanded bennigsen directed toll started due order always happens got somewhere their appointed places
always happens men starting cheerfully began halt murmurs heard there sense confusion finally backward movement
adjutants generals galloped about shouted grew angry quarreled said come quite wrong late gave vent little abuse last gave all went forward simply get somewhere
shall get somewhere other did indeed get somewhere though their right places few eventually even got their right place late use only time fired 
toll battle played part weyrother austerlitz galloped assiduously from place place finding everything upside down everywhere
thus stumbled bagov corps wood when already broad daylight though corps should long before joined orl den sov
excited vexed failure supposing someone must responsible toll galloped commander corps began upbraiding severely saying ought shot
general bagov fighting old soldier placid temperament being also upset all delay confusion cross purposes fell into rage everybody surprise quite contrary usual character said disagreeable things toll
prefer take lessons from anyone can die men well anybody said advanced single division
coming out onto field under enemy fire brave general went straight ahead leading men under fire without considering agitation whether going into action now single division would use 
danger cannon balls bullets just needed angry mood
one first bullets killed other bullets killed many men
division remained under fire time quite uselessly
meanwhile another columnattacked french from front kut zov accompanied column
well knew nothing confusion would come battle undertaken against will far power held troops back
rode silently small gray horse indolently answering suggestions should attack
word attack always your tongue don see are unable execute complicated maneuvers said milor dovich asked permission advance
couldn take murat prisoner morning get place time nothing can done now replied someone else
when kut zov informed french rear where according reports cossacks there previously been nobody there now two battalions poles gave sidelong glance erm lov behind whom spoken since previous day
see are asking attack making plans all kinds soon one gets business nothing ready enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly
erm lov screwed eyes smiled faintly hearing words
understood storm blown over kut zov would content himself hint
having little fun expense said erm lov softly nudging knee vski side
soon after erm lov moved kut zov respectfully remarked late yet your highness enemy gone away order attack guards will much see little smoke
kut zov did reply when reported murat troops retreat ordered advance though every hundred paces halted three quarters hour
whole battle consisted orl den sov cossacks done rest army merely lost hundreds men uselessly
consequence battle kut zov received diamond decoration bennigsen diamonds hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding their various grades following battle fresh changes made staff
everything done all topsy turvy said russian officers generals after tar tino battle letting understood fool there doing things all wrong ourselves should done just people speak today
people talk like either know are talking about deliberately deceive themselves
battle tar tino borodin austerlitz takes place those planned anticipated
countless number free forces nowhere man freer than during battle where question life death influence course taken fight course never can known advance never coincides direction one force
many simultaneously variously directed forcesact given body direction motion cannot coincide one those forceswill always mean mechanics represented diagonal parallelogram forces
descriptions given historians especially french ones find their wars battles carried out accordance previously formed plans only conclusion drawn those descriptions are false
battle tar tino obviously did attain aim toll view lead troops into action order prescribed dispositions nor count orl den sov may view take murat prisoner nor result immediately destroying whole corps bennigsen others may view nor aim officer wished into action distinguish himself nor cossack wanted more booty than got 
aim battle actually resulted all russians day desired drive french out russia destroy their army quite clear battle tar tino just incongruities exactly wanted stage campaign
would difficult even impossible imagine result more opportune than actual outcome battle
minimum effort insignificant losses despite greatest confusion most important results whole campaign attained transition from retreat advance exposure weakness french administration shock napoleon army only awaited begin flight
napoleon enters moscow after brilliant victory moskowa there can doubt about victory battlefield remains hands french
moscow abounding provisions arms munitions incalculable wealth napoleon hands
russian army only half strength french does make single attempt attack whole month
napoleon position most brilliant
can either fall russian army double strength destroy negotiate advantageous peace case refusal make menacing move petersburg even case reverse return smol nsk lna remain moscow short special genius would seem required retain brilliant position french held time
only very simple easy steps necessary allow troops loot prepare winter clothing there sufficient moscow whole army methodically collect provisions according french historians there enough moscow supply whole army six months
yet napoleon greatest all geniuses historians declare control army took none steps
merely did nothing kind contrary used power select most foolish ruinous all courses open 
all napoleon might done wintering moscow advancing petersburg zhni vgorod retiring more northerly more southerly route say road kut zov afterwards took nothing more stupid disastrous can imagined than actually did
remained moscow till october letting troops plunder city hesitating whether leave garrison behind quitted moscow approached kut zov without joining battle turned right reached yarosl vets again without attempting break through take roadkut zov took retiring instead mozh ysk along devastated smol nsk road
nothing more stupid than could been devised more disastrous army sequel showed
napoleon aim been destroy army most skillful strategist could hardly devised series actions would completely accomplished purpose independently anything russian army might 
napoleon man geniusdid say destroyed army wished very stupid would unjust say brought troops moscow wished very clever genius
both cases personal activity having more force than personal activity soldier merely coincided laws guided event
historians quite falsely represent napoleon faculties having weakened moscow only results did justify actions
employed all ability strength best could himself army done previously did subsequently 1813
activity time less astounding than egypt italy austria prussia
know certain far genius genuine egypt where forty centuries looked down upon grandeur great exploits there are all told frenchmen
cannot accurately estimate genius austria prussia draw our information from french german sources incomprehensible surrender whole corps without fighting fortresses without siege must incline germans recognize genius only explanation war carried germany
thank god need recognize genius order hide our shame

during whole period napoleon seems been leader all movements figurehead ship may seem savage guide vessel acted like child holding couple strings inside carriage thinks driving 
early morning sixth october pierre went out shed returning stopped door play little blue gray dog long body short bandy legs jumped about 
little dog lived their shed sleeping beside karat night sometimes made excursions into town always returned again
probably never owner still belonged nobody name
french called azor soldier told stories called femg lka karat others called gray sometimes flabby
lack master name even breed definite color did seem trouble blue gray dog least
furry tail stood firm round plume bandy legs served well would often gracefully lift hind leg run very easily quickly three legs disdaining use all four
now would roll back yelping delight now bask sun thoughtful air importance now frolic about playing chip wood straw
pierre attire now consisted dirty torn shirt only remnant former clothing pair soldier trousers karat advice tied string round ankles warmth peasant coat cap
longer seemed stout though still appearance solidity strength hereditary family
beard mustache covered lower part face tangle hair infested lice curled round head like cap
look eyes resolute calm animatedly alert never before
former slackness shown itself even eyes now replaced energetic readiness action resistance
feet bare
pierre first looked down field across vehicles horsemen passing morning into distance across river dog pretending earnest about biting bare feet placed pleasure various positions moving dirty thick big toes
every time looked bare feet smile animated self satisfaction flitted across face
sight reminded all experienced learned during weeks recollection pleasant 
days weather been calm clear slight frosts mornings called old wives summer
sunshine airwarm warmth particularly pleasant invigorating freshness morning frost still air
everything far near lay magic crystal glitter seen only time autumn
sparrow hills visible distance village church large white house
bare trees sand bricks roofs houses green church spire corners white house distance all stood out transparent air most delicate outline unnatural clearness
near could seen familiar ruins half burned mansion occupied french lilac bushes still showing dark green beside fence
even ruined befouled house dull weather repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now clear motionless brilliance
french corporal coat unbuttoned homely way skullcap head short pipe mouth came from behind corner shed approached pierre friendly wink
sunshine monsieur kiril their name pierre
just like spring corporal leaned against door offered pierre pipe though whenever offered pierre always declined 
march such weather
pierre inquired being said about leaving corporal told nearly all troops starting there ought order about prisoners day
sokol one soldiers shed pierre dying pierre told corporal something should done about 
corporal replied pierre need worry about ambulance permanent hospital arrangements would made sick general everything could happen been foreseen authorities
besides monsieur kiril only say word captain know
speak captain when makes round will anything 
captain whom corporal spoke often long chats pierre showed all sorts favors
see 
thomas said other day
monsieur kiril man education speaks french
russian seigneur misfortunes man
wants anything asks won get refusal
when one studied see one likes education well bred people
your sake mention monsieur kiril
other day been affair would ended ill
after chatting longer corporal went away
affair alluded happened few days before fight between prisoners french soldiers pierre succeeded pacifying comrades
prisoners heard pierre talking corporal immediately asked frenchman said
pierre repeating been told about army leaving moscow thin sallow tattered french soldier came door shed
rapidly timidly raising fingers forehead way greeting asked pierre whether soldier platoche whom given shirt sew shed
week before french boot leather linen issued given out prisoners make into boots shirts 
ready ready dear fellow said karat coming out neatly folded shirt
karat account warm weather convenience work wearing only trousers tattered shirt black soot
hair bound round workman fashion wisp lime tree bast round face seemed rounder pleasanter than ever
promise own brother performance said friday ready said plat smiling unfolding shirt sewn
frenchman glanced around uneasily overcoming hesitation rapidly threw off uniform put shirt
long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next sallow thin bare body shirt
evidently afraid prisoners looking would laugh thrust head into shirt hurriedly
none prisoners said word
see fits well plat kept repeating pulling shirt straight
frenchman having pushed head hands through without raising eyes looked down shirt examined seams
see dear man sewing shop proper tools say one needs tool even kill louse said plat one round smiles obviously pleased work
good quite good thank said frenchman french there must linen left over
will fit better still when sets your body said karat still admiring handiwork
thanks thanks old fellow
bits left over said frenchman again smiled
took out assignation ruble note gave karat 
pierre saw plat did want understand frenchman saying looked without interfering
karat thanked frenchman money went admiring own work
frenchman insisted having pieces returned left over asked pierre translate said
does want bits said karat 
make fine leg bands 
karat suddenly changed saddened expression took small bundle scraps from inside shirt gave frenchman without looking 
dear muttered karat went away
frenchman looked linen considered moment looked inquiringly pierre pierre look told something suddenly blushed shouted squeaky voice platoche platoche keep yourself handing back odd bits turned went out
there look said karat swaying head
people said christians souls
old folk used say sweating hand open hand dry hand close
naked yet given back
karat smiled thoughtfully silent awhile looking pieces
make grand leg bands dear friend said went back into shed
four weeks passed since pierre been taken prisoner though french offered move from men officers shed stayed shed where first put
burned devastated moscow pierre experienced almost extreme limits privation man can endure thanks physical strength health till been unconscious thanks especially fact privations came gradually impossible say when began endured position only lightly joyfully
just time obtained tranquillity ease mind formerly striven vain reach
long sought different ways tranquillity mind inner harmony impressed soldiers battle borodin 
sought philanthropy freemasonry dissipations town life wine heroic feats self sacrifice romantic love nat sha sought reasoning all quests experiments failed 
now without thinking about found peace inner harmony only through horror death through privation through recognized karat 
those dreadful moments lived through executions forever washed away from imagination memory agitating thoughts feelings formerly seemed important
did now occur think russia war politics napoleon
plain all things business called judge concerning therefore could 
russia summer weather are bound together thought repeating words karat found strangely consoling
intention killing napoleon calculations cabalistic number beast apocalypse now seemed meaningless even ridiculous
anger wife anxiety name should smirched now seemed merely trivial even amusing
concern somewhere other woman leading life preferred did matter anybody especially whether found out their prisoner name count bez khov now often remembered conversation prince andrew quite agreed though understood prince andrew thoughts somewhat differently
prince andrew thought said happiness could only negative said shade bitterness irony though really saying all desire positive happiness implanted merely torment never satisfied
pierre believed without mental reservation
absence suffering satisfaction one needs consequent freedom choice one occupation one way life now seemed pierre indubitably man highest happiness
now first time fully appreciated enjoyment eating when wanted eat drinking when wanted drink sleeping when wanted sleep warmth when cold talking fellow man when wished talk hear human voice
satisfaction one needs good food cleanliness freedom now deprived all seemed pierre constitute perfect happiness choice occupationway life now restricted seemed such easy matter forgot superfluity comforts life destroys all joy satisfying one needs great freedom choice occupationsuch freedom wealth education social position given own life just makes choice occupationinsolubly difficult destroys desire possibility having occupation
all pierre daydreams now turned time when would free
yet subsequently rest life thought spoke enthusiasm month captivity those irrecoverable strong joyful sensations chiefly complete peace mind inner freedom experienced only during those weeks
when first day got early went out shed dawn saw cupolas crosses new convent virgin still dark first hoarfrost dusty grass sparrow hills wooded banks above winding river vanishing purple distance when felt contact fresh air heard noise crows flying from moscow across field when afterwards light gleamed from east sun rim appeared solemnly from behind cloud cupolas crosses hoarfrost distance river all began sparkle glad light pierre felt new joy strength life such never before known
only stayed during whole imprisonment even grew strength hardships position increased
feeling alertness readiness anything still further strengthened high opinion fellow prisoners formed soon after arrival shed
knowledge languages respect shown french simplicity readiness give anything asked received allowance three rubles week made officers strength showed soldiers pressing nails into walls hut gentleness companions capacity sitting still thinking without doing anything seemed incomprehensible appeared rather mysterious superior being
very qualities been hindrance actually harmful world lived strength disdain comforts life absent mindedness simplicity among people gave almost status hero
pierre felt their opinion placed responsibilities upon 
french evacuation began night between sixth seventh october kitchens sheds dismantled carts loaded troops baggage trains started
seven morning french convoy marching trim wearing shakos carrying muskets knapsacks enormous sacks stood front sheds animated french talk mingled curses sounded all along lines
shed everyone ready dressed belted shod only awaited order start
sick soldier sokol pale thin dark shadows round eyes alone sat place barefoot dressed
eyes prominent from emaciation face gazed inquiringly comrades paying attention moaned regularly quietly
evidently much sufferings caused moan dysentery fear grief being left alone
pierre girt rope round waist wearing shoes karat made from leather french soldier torn off tea chest brought boots mended went sick man squatted down beside 
know sokol are all going away hospital 
may better off than others said pierre
lord will death lord moaned man louder voice
ask again directly said pierre rising going door shed
just pierre reached door corporal offered pipe day before came two soldiers
corporal soldiers marching kit knapsacks shakos metal straps changed their familiar faces
corporal came according orders shut door
prisoners counted before being let out
corporal will sick man 
even spoke began doubt whether corporal knew stranger unlike himself did corporal seem moment
moreover just pierre speaking sharp rattle drums suddenly heard from both sides
corporal frowned pierre words uttering meaningless oaths slammed door
shed became semidark sharp rattle drums two sides drowned sick man groans
there 
said pierre himself involuntary shudder ran down spine
corporal changed face sound voice stirring deafening noise drums recognized mysterious callous force compelled people against their will kill their fellow men force effect witnessed during executions
fear try escape force address entreaties exhortations those served tools useless
did again sick man nor turn look stood frowning door hut
when door opened prisoners crowding against one another like flock sheep squeezed into exit pierre pushed way forward approached very captain corporal assured ready anything 
captain also marching kit cold face appeared same pierre recognized corporal words roll drums
pass pass captain reiterated frowning sternly looking prisoners thronged past 
pierre went though knew attempt would vain
now officer asked cold look recognizing pierre
pierre told about sick man
manage walk devil take said captain
pass pass continued without looking pierre
dying pierre again began
good
dram damdamdam
rattled drums pierre understood mysterious force completely controlled men now useless say more
officer prisoners separated from soldiers told march front
there about thirty officers pierre among about three hundred men
officers come from other sheds all strangers pierre much better dressed than 
looked shoes mistrustfully alien
far from walked fat major sallow bloated angry face wearing kaz dressing gown tied round towel evidently enjoyed respect fellow prisoners
kept one hand clasped tobacco pouch inside bosom dressing gown held stem pipe firmly other
panting puffing major grumbled growled everybody thought being pushed all hurrying when nowhere hurry all surprised something when there nothing surprised 
another thin little officer speaking everyone conjecturing where now being taken far would get day
official felt boots wearing commissariat uniform ran round from side side gazed ruins moscow loudly announcing observations been burned down part city could see
third officer accent pole disputed commissariat officer arguing mistaken identification different wards moscow
are disputing about said major angrily
does matter whether 
blasius see burned down there end 
are pushing isn road wide enough said turning man behind pushing all
done prisoners one side another heard saying gazed charred ruins
all beyond river bova mlin
just look there half left
yes told whole quarter beyond river 
well know burned use talking said major
passed near church kham vniki one few unburned quarters moscow whole mass prisoners suddenly started one side exclamations horror disgust heard
villains heathens yes dead dead 
smeared something pierre drew near churchwhere thing evoked exclamations dimly made out something leaning against palings surrounding church
from words comrades saw better than did found body man set upright against palings face smeared soot
devil
convoy guards began cursing french soldiers fresh virulence drove away their swords crowd prisoners gazing dead man
through cross streets kham vniki quarter prisoners marched followed only their escort vehicleswagons belonging escort when reached supply stores came among huge closely packed train artillery mingled private vehicles
bridge all halted waiting those front get across
from bridge view endless lines moving baggage trains before behind 
right where kal road turns near nesk chny endless rows troops carts stretched away into distance
troops beauharnais corps started before others
behind along riverside across stone bridge ney troops transport
davout troops whose charge prisoners crossing crimean bridge already debouching into kal road
baggage trains stretched out last beauharnais train yet got out moscow reached kal road when vanguard ney army already emerging from great ord nka street
when crossed crimean bridge prisoners moved few steps forward halted again moved from all sides vehicles men crowded closer closer together
advanced few hundred paces separated bridge from kal road taking more than hour came out upon square where streets transmoskv ward kal road converge prisoners jammed close together stand hours crossway
from all sides like roar sea heard rattle wheels tramp feet incessant shouts anger abuse
pierre stood pressed against wall charred house listening noise mingled imagination roll drums
get better view several officer prisoners climbed onto wall half burned house against pierre leaning
crowds just look crowds 
loaded goods even cannon look there those are furs exclaimed
just see blackguards looted
there see one behind cart
why those are settings taken from icons heaven 
rascals 
see fellow loaded himself can hardly walk good lord even grabbed those chaises 
see fellow there sitting trunks
right hit snout snout like shan get away before evening
why must napoleon own
see horses monograms crown like portable house
fellow dropped sack doesn see 
woman baby bad looking either yes dare say way let pass
just look there end 
russian wenches heaven are carriages see comfortably settled themselves again church kham vniki wave general curiositybore all prisoners forward onto road pierre thanks stature saw over heads others attracted their curiosity
three carriages involved among munition carts closely squeezed together sat women rouged faces dressed glaring colors shouting something shrill voices
from moment pierre recognized appearance mysterious force nothing seemed strange dreadful neither corpse smeared soot fun nor women hurrying away nor burned ruins moscow
all now witnessed scarcely made impression soul making ready hard struggle refused receive impressions might weaken 
women vehicles drove 
behind came more carts soldiers wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition carts more soldiers now women
pierre did see people individuals saw their movement
all people horses seemed driven forward invisible power
during hour pierre watched all came flowing from different streets one same desire get quickly all jostled one another began grow angry fight white teeth gleamed brows frowned ever same words abuse flew from side side all faces bore same swaggeringly resolute coldly cruel expression struck pierre morning corporal face when drums beating
till nearly evening officer commanding escort collected men shouts quarrels forced way among baggage trains prisoners hemmed all sides emerged onto kal road
marched very quickly without resting halted only when sun began set
baggage carts drew close together men began prepare their night rest
all appeared angry dissatisfied
long time oaths angry shouts fighting could heard from all sides
carriage followed escort ran into one carts knocked hole pole
several soldiers ran toward cart from different sides beat carriage horses their heads turning aside others fought among themselves pierre saw one german badly wounded head sword
seemed all men now stopped amid fields chill dusk autumn evening experienced one same feeling unpleasant awakening from hurry eagerness push seized start
once standstill all seemed understand did yet know where going much painful difficult awaited journey
during halt escort treated prisoners even worse than done start
prisoners first time received horseflesh their meat ration
from officer down lowest soldier showed seemed like personal spite against each prisoners unexpected contrast their former friendly relations
spite increased still more when calling over roll prisoners found bustle leaving moscow one russian soldier pretended suffer from colic escaped
pierre saw frenchman beat russiansoldier cruelly straying far from road heard friend captain reprimand threaten court martial noncommissioned officer account escape russian
noncommissioned officer excuse prisoner ill could walk officer replied order shoot those lagged behind
pierre felt fatal force crushed during executions felt during imprisonment now again controlled existence
terrible felt proportion efforts fatal force crush there grew strengthened soul power life independent 
ate supper buckwheat soup horseflesh chatted comrades
neither pierre nor others spoke seen moscow roughness their treatment french order shoot been announced 
reaction against worsening their position all particularly animated gay
spoke personal reminiscences amusing scenes witnessed during campaign avoided all talk their present situation
sun set long since
bright stars shone out there sky
red glow conflagration spread above horizon from rising full moon vast red ball swayed strangely gray haze
evening ending night yet come
pierre got left new companions crossing between campfires other side road where been told common soldier prisoners stationed
road stopped french sentinel ordered back
pierre turned back companions campfire unharnessed cart where there nobody
tucking legs under dropping head sat down cold ground wheel cart remained motionless long sunk thought
suddenly burst out into fit broad good natured laughter loud men from various sides turned surprise see strange evidently solitary laughter could mean
laughed pierre
said aloud himself soldier did let pass
immortal soul 
laughed till tears started eyes
man got came see queer big fellow laughing all himself
pierre stopped laughing got went farther away from inquisitive man looked around 
huge endless bivouac previously resounded crackling campfires voices many men grown quiet red campfires growing paler dying down
high light sky hung full moon
forests fields beyond camp unseen before now visible distance
farther still beyond those forests fields bright oscillating limitless distance lured one itself
pierre glanced sky twinkling stars faraway depths
all all within all thought pierre
caught all put into shed boarded planks smiled went lay down sleep beside companions
early days october another envoy came kut zov letter from napoleon proposing peace falsely dated from moscow though napoleon already far from kut zov old kal road
kut zov replied letter done one formerly brought lauriston saying there could question peace
soon after report received from rokhov guerrilla detachment operating left tar tino troops broussier division been seen form nsk being separated from rest french army might easily destroyed
soldiers officers again demanded action
generals staff excited memory easy victory tar tino urged kut zov carry out rokhov suggestion
kut zov did consider offensive necessary
result compromise inevitable small detachment sent form nsk attack broussier
strange coincidence task turned out most difficult important one entrusted dokht rov same modest little dokht rov whom one described drawing plans battles dashing about front regiments showering crosses batteries thought spoken undecided undiscerning whom find commanding wherever position most difficult all through russo french wars from austerlitz year 1813
austerlitz remained last augezd dam rallying regiments saving possible when all flying perishing single general left rear guard
ill fever went smol nsk twenty thousand men defend town against napoleon whole army
smol nsk mal khov gate hardly dozed off paroxysm fever before awakened bombardment town smol nsk held out all day long
battle borodin when bagrati killed nine tenths men our left flank fallen full force french artillery fire directed against man sent there same irresolute undiscerning dokht rov kut zov hastening rectify mistake made sending someone else there first
quiet little dokht rov rode thither borodin became greatest glory russian army
many heroes been described verse prose dokht rov scarcely word been said
dokht rov again whom sent form nsk from there yarosl vets place where last battle french fought where obvious disintegration french army began are told many geniuses heroes period campaign dokht rov nothing very little said dubiously
silence about dokht rov clearest testimony merit
natural man does understand workings machine imagine shaving fallen into chance interfering action tossing about most important part
man does understand construction machine cannot conceive small connecting cogwheel revolves quietly one most essential parts machine shaving merely harms hinders working
tenth october when dokht rov gone halfway form nsk stopped village arist preparing faithfully execute orders received whole french army having convulsive movement reached murat position apparently order give battle suddenly without reason turned off left onto new kal road began enter form nsk where only broussier been till 
time dokht rov under command besides rokhov detachment two small guerrilla detachments figner sesl vin
evening october sesl vin came arist headquarters french guardsman captured
prisoner said troops entered form nsk day vanguard whole army napoleon there whole army left moscow four days previously
same evening house serf come from rovsk said seen immense army entering town
cossacks dokht rov detachment reported having sighted french guards marching along road rovsk
from all reports evident where expected meet single division there now whole french army marching from moscow unexpected direction along kal road
dokht rov unwilling undertake action clear now ought 
been ordered attack form nsk
only broussier been theretime now whole french army there
erm lov wished act own judgment dokht rov insisted must kut zov instructions
decided send dispatch staff
purpose capable officer bolkhov tinov chosen explain whole affair word mouth besides delivering written report
toward midnight bolkhov tinov having received dispatch verbal instructions galloped off general staff accompanied cossack spare horses
warm dark autumn night
having changed horses twice galloped twenty miles hour half over sticky muddy road bolkhov tinov reached litash vka after one clock night
dismounting cottage whose wattle fence hung signboard general staff throwing down reins entered dark passage
general duty quick very important said someone risen sniffing dark passage
been very unwell since evening third night slept said orderly pleadingly whisper
should wake captain first
very important from general dokht rov said bolkhov tinov entering open door found feeling dark
orderly gone before began waking somebody
your honor your honor courier
from whom came sleepy voice
from dokht rov from alex petr vich
napoleon form nsk said bolkhov tinov unable see dark speaking guessing voice konovn tsyn
man wakened yawned stretched himself
don like waking said fumbling something
very ill
dispatch said bolkhov tinov
orders are give once general duty
wait moment light candle
damned rascal where always hide said voice man stretching himself orderly
shcherb nin konovn tsyn adjutant
found found added
orderly striking light shcherb nin fumbling something candlestick
nasty beasts said disgust
light sparks bolkhov tinov saw shcherb nin youthful face held candle face another man still asleep
konovn tsyn
when flame sulphur splinters kindled tinder burned first blue red shcherb nin lit tallow candle from candlestick cockroaches been gnawing running away looked messenger
bolkhov tinov bespattered all over mud smeared face wiping sleeve
gave report inquired shcherb nin taking envelope
news reliable said bolkhov tinov
prisoners cossacks scouts all say same thing
there nothing done wake said shcherb nin rising going man nightcap lay covered greatcoat
general staff said smile knowing those words would sure arouse 
fact head nightcap lifted once
konovn tsyn handsome resolute face cheeks flushed fever there still remained instant faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs suddenly started face assumed habitual calm firm appearance
well from whom asked immediately without hurry blinking light
listening officer report konovn tsyn broke seal read dispatch
hardly done before lowered legs their woolen stockings earthen floor began putting boots
took off nightcap combed hair over temples donned cap
did get quickly let highness
konovn tsyn understood once news brought great importance time must lost
did consider ask himself whether news good bad
regarded whole business war intelligence reason something else
there within deep unexpressed conviction all would well one must trust still less speak about must only attend one own work
did work giving whole strength task
peter petr vich konovn tsyn like dokht rov seems been included merely propriety sake list called heroes 1812 barclays vskis erm lovs tovs milor doviches
like dokht rov reputation being man very limited capacity information like dokht rov never made plans battle always found where situation most difficult
since appointment general duty always slept door open giving orders every messenger should allowed wake 
battle always under fire kut zov reproved feared send front like dokht rov one those unnoticed cogwheels without clatter noise constitute most essential part machine
coming out hut into damp dark night konovn tsyn frowned partly from increased pain head partly unpleasant thought occurred all nest influential men staff would stirred news especially bennigsen ever since tar tino been daggers drawn kut zov would make suggestions quarrel issue orders rescind 
premonition disagreeable though knew could helped
fact toll whom went communicate news immediately began expound plans general sharing quarters until konovn tsyn listened weary silence reminded must see highness
kut zov like all old people did sleep much night
often fell asleep unexpectedly daytime night lying bed without undressing generally remained awake thinking
lay now bed supporting large heavy scarred head plump hand one eye open meditating peering into darkness
since bennigsen corresponded emperor more influence than anyone else staff begun avoid kut zov more ease possibility himself troops being obliged take part useless aggressive movements
lesson tar tino battle day before kut zov remembered pain must thought effect others 
must understand can only lose taking offensive
patience time are warriors champions thought kut zov
knew apple should plucked green
will fall itself when ripe picked unripe apple spoiled tree harmed your teeth are set edge
like experienced sportsman knew beast wounded wounded only whole strength russia could wounded whether mortally wounded still undecided question
now fact lauriston barth lemi having been sent reports guerrillas kut zov almost sure wound mortal
needed further proofs necessary wait
want run see wounded 
wait shall see continual maneuvers continual advances thought 
only distinguish themselves fighting fun
are like children from whom one can get sensible account happened all want show well can fight
needed now
ingenious maneuvers all propose seems when thought two three contingencies remembered general plan sent from petersburg foreseen everything
contingencies are endless
undecided question whether wound inflicted borodin mortal hung over kut zov head whole month
one hand french occupied moscow
other kut zov felt assured all being terrible blow into all russians put their whole strength must been mortal
case proofs needed waitedwhole month grew more impatient longer waited
lying bed during those sleepless nights did just reproached those younger generals doing
imagined all sorts possible contingencies just like younger men difference saw thousands contingencies instead two three based nothing 
longer thought more contingencies presented themselves
imagined all sorts movements napoleonic army whole sections against petersburg against outflank 
thought possibility feared most all napoleon might fight own weapon remain moscow awaiting 
kut zov even imagined napoleon army might turn back through med yukhn one thing could foresee happened insane convulsive stampede napoleon army during first eleven days after leaving moscow stampede made possible kut zov yet even dared think complete extermination french
rokhov report about broussier division guerrillas reports distress napoleon army rumors preparations leaving moscow all confirmed supposition french army beaten preparing flight
only suppositions seemed important younger men kut zov
sixty years experience knew value attach rumors knew apt people desire anything are group all news appears confirm desire knew readily such cases omit all makes contrary
more desired less allowed himself believe 
all else only life customary routine
such customary routine belonged conversations staff letters wrote from tar tino madame sta reading novels distribution awards correspondence petersburg 
destruction french alone foresaw heart one desire
night eleventh october lay leaning arm thinking 
there stir next room heard steps toll konovn tsyn bolkhov tinov
there come come news field marshal called out 
footman lighting candle toll communicated substance news
brought asked kut zov look when candle lit struck toll cold severity
there can doubt about your highness
call call 
kut zov sat one leg hanging down from bed big paunch resting against other doubled under 
screwed seeing eye scrutinize messenger more carefully wishing read face preoccupied own mind
tell tell friend said bolkhov tinov low aged voice pulled together shirt gaped open chest come nearernearer
news brought napoleon left moscow are sure bolkhov tinov gave detailed account from beginning all been told report
speak quicker quicker don torture kut zov interrupted 
bolkhov tinov told everything silent awaiting instructions
toll beginning say something kut zov checked 
tried say something face suddenly puckered wrinkled waved arm toll turned opposite side room corner darkened icons hung there
lord creator thou heard our prayer
said tremulous voice folded hands
thank thee lord wept
from time received news end campaign all kut zov activity directed toward restraining troops authority guile entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers encounters perishing enemy
dokht rov went yarosl vets kut zov lingered main army gave orders evacuation kal retreat beyond town seemed quite possible
everywhere kut zov retreated enemy without waiting retreat fled opposite direction
napoleon historians describe skilled maneuvers tar tino yarosl vets make conjectures would happened napoleon been time penetrate into rich southern provinces
speak fact nothing prevented from advancing into those southern provinces russian army did bar way historians forget nothing could saved army already bore within itself germs inevitable ruin
could army found abundant supplies moscow trampled underfoot instead keeping arriving smol nsk looted provisions instead storing could army recuperate kal province inhabited russians such those lived moscow where fire same property consuming set ablaze army could recover anywhere
since battle borodin pillage moscow borne within itself chemical elements dissolution
members once been army napoleon himself all soldiers fled without knowing whither each concerned only make escape quickly possible from position hopelessness all more less vaguely conscious
came about council yarosl vets when generals pretending confer together expressed various opinions all mouths closed opinion uttered simple minded soldier mouton speaking last said all felt one thing needful get away quickly possible one even napoleon could say anything against truth all recognized
though all realized necessary get away there still remained feeling shame admitting must flee
external shock needed overcome shame shock came due time
french called hourra empereur
day after council yarosl vets napoleon rode out early morning amid lines army suite marshals escort pretext inspecting army scene previous impending battle
cossacks prowl booty fell emperor very nearly captured 
cossacks did capture napoleon saved very thing destroying french army booty cossacks fell
tar tino went after plunder leaving men
disregarding napoleon rushed after plunder napoleon managed escape
when les enfants don might easily taken emperor himself midst army clear there nothing fly fast possible along nearest familiar road
napoleon forty year old stomach understood hint feeling former agility boldness under influence fright cossacks given once agreed mouton issued orders historians tell retreat smol nsk road
napoleon agreed mouton army retreated does prove napoleon caused retreat forces influenced whole army directed along mozh ysk smol nsk road acted simultaneously also
man motionalways devises aim motion
able thousand milesmust imagine something good awaits end those thousand miles
one must prospect promised land strength move
promised landfrench during their advance been moscow during their retreat their native land
native land far off man going thousand miles absolutely necessary set aside final goal say himself today shall get place twenty five miles off where shall rest spend night during first day journey resting place eclipses ultimate goal attracts all hopes desires
impulses felt single person are always magnified crowd
french retreating along old smol nsk road final goal their native land remote their immediate goal smol nsk toward all their desires hopes enormously intensified mass urged 
knew much food fresh troops awaited smol nsk nor told contrary their superior officers napoleon himself knew provisions scarce there alone could give strength move endure their present privations
both those knew those did know deceived themselves pushed smol nsk promised land
coming out onto highroad french fled surprising energy unheard rapidity toward goal fixed 
besides common impulse bound whole crowd french into one mass supplied certain energy there another cause binding together their great numbers
physical law gravity their enormous mass drew individual human atoms itself
their hundreds thousands moved like whole nation
each desired nothing more than give himself prisoner escape from all horror misery one hand force common attraction smol nsk their goal drew each same direction other hand army corps could surrender company though french availed themselves every convenient opportunity detach themselves surrender slightest decent pretext such pretexts did always occur
their very numbers their crowded swift movement deprived possibility rendered only difficult impossible russians stop movement french directing all their energies
beyond certain limit mechanical disruption body could hasten process decomposition
lump snow cannot melted instantaneously
there certain limit time less than amount heat can melt snow
contrary greater heat more solidified remaining snow becomes
russian commanders kut zov alone understood 
when flight french army along smol nsk road became well defined konovn tsyn foreseen night eleventh october began occur
superior officers all wanted distinguish themselves cut off seize capture overthrow french all clamored action
kut zov alone used all power such power very limited case commander chief prevent attack
could tell say now why fight why block road losing our own men inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches use when third their army melted away road from moscow zma without battle drawing from aged wisdom could understand told golden bridge laughed slandered flinging themselves rending exulting over dying beast
erm lov milor dovich tov others proximity french near zma could resist their desire cut off break two french corps way reporting their intention kut zov sent blank sheet paper envelope
try kut zov might restrain troops our men attacked trying bar road
infantry regiments are told advanced attack music drums beating killed lost thousands men
did cut off overthrow anybody french army closing more firmly danger continued steadily melting away pursue fatal path smol nsk
battle borodin occupation moscow followed flight french without further conflicts one most instructive phenomena history
all historians agree external activity states nations their conflicts one another expressed wars direct result greater less success war political strength states nations increases decreases
strange may historical account king emperor having quarreled another collects army fights enemy army gains victory killing three five ten thousand men subjugates kingdom entire nation several millions all facts history far know confirm truth statement greater lesser success one army against another cause least essential indication increase decrease strength nation even though unintelligible why defeat army hundredth part nation should oblige whole nation submit
army gains victory once rights conquering nation increased detriment defeated
army suffered defeat once people loses rights proportion severity reverse army suffers complete defeat nation quite subjugated
according history been found from most ancient times our own day
proportion defeat austrian army austria loses rights rights strength france increase
victories french jena auerst destroy independent existence prussia
1812 french gain victory near moscow
moscow taken after further battles russia ceases exist french army six hundred thousand napoleonic france itself
strain facts fit rules history say field battle borodin remained hands russians after moscow there other battles destroyed napoleon army impossible
after french victory borodin there general engagement nor all serious yet french army ceased exist
does mean example taken from history china might say historic phenomenon historians usual expedient when anything does fit their standards matter concerned brief conflict only small number troops took part might treat exception event occurred before our fathers eyes question life death their fatherland happened greatest all known wars
period campaign 1812 from battle borodin expulsion french proved winning battle does produce conquest even invariable indication conquest proved force decides fate peoples lies conquerors nor even armies battles something else
french historians describing condition french army before left moscow affirm all order grand army except cavalry artillery transport there forage horses cattle
misfortune one could remedy peasants district burned their hay rather than let french 
victory gained did bring usual results peasants karp vlas after french evacuated moscow drove their carts pillage town general personally failed manifest heroic feelings whole innumerable multitude such peasants did bring their hay moscow high price offered burned instead
let imagine two men come out fight duel rapiers according all rules art fencing
fencing gone time suddenly one combatants feeling himself wounded understanding matter joke concerns life throws down rapier seizing first cudgel comes hand begins brandish 
let imagine combatant sensibly employed best simplest means attain end same time influenced traditions chivalry desiring conceal facts case insisted gained victory rapier according all rules art
one can imagine confusion obscurity would result from such account duel
fencer demanded contest according rules fencing french army opponent threw away rapier snatched cudgel russian people those try explain matter according rules fencing are historians described event
after burning smol nsk warbegan did follow previous traditions war
burning towns villages retreats after battles blow dealt borodin renewed retreat burning moscow capture marauders seizure transports guerrilla war all departures from rules
napoleon felt from time took correct fencing attitude moscow instead opponent rapier saw cudgel raised above head did cease complain kut zov emperor alexander war being carried contrary all rules there rules killing people
spite complaints french nonobservance rules spite fact highly placed russians seemed rather disgraceful fight cudgel wanted assume pose quarte tierce according all rules make adroit thrust prime cudgel people war lifted all menacing majestic strength without consulting anyone tastes rules regardless anything else rose fell stupid simplicity consistently belabored french till whole invasion perished
well people french did 1813 salute according all rules art presenting hilt their rapier gracefully politely hand their magnanimous conqueror moment trial without asking rules others adopted similar cases simply easily pick first cudgel comes hand strike till feeling resentment revenge their soul yields feeling contempt compassion
one most obvious advantageous departures from called laws war action scattered groups against men pressed together mass
such action always occurs wars take national character
such actions instead two crowds opposing each other men disperse attack singly run away when attacked stronger forces again attack when opportunity offers
done guerrillas spain mountain tribes caucasus russians 1812
people called kind war guerrilla warfare assume calling explained meaning
such war does fit under rule directly opposed well known rule tactics accepted infallible
rule says attacker should concentrate forces order stronger than opponent moment conflict
guerrilla war always successful history shows directly infringes rule
contradiction arises from fact military science assumes strength army identical numbers
military science says more troops greater strength
les gros bataillons ont toujours raison
military science say like defining momentum mechanics reference mass only stating momenta are equal unequaleach other simply masses involved are equal unequal
momentum quantity motion product mass velocity
military affairs strength army product mass unknown 
military science seeing history innumerable instances fact size army does coincide strength small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits existence unknown factor tries discover now geometric formation now equipment employed now most usually genius commanders
assignment various meanings factor does yield results accord historic facts
yet only necessary abandon false view adopted gratify heroes efficacy directions issued wartime commanders order find unknown quantity
unknown quantity spirit army say greater lesser readiness fight face danger felt all men composing army quite independently whether are are fighting under command genius two three line formation cudgels rifles repeat thirty times minute
men want fight will always put themselves most advantageous conditions fighting
spirit army factor multiplied mass gives resulting force
define express significance unknown factor spirit army problem science
problem only solvable cease arbitrarily substitute unknown itself conditions under force becomes apparent such commands general equipment employed mistaking real significance factor recognize unknown quantity entirety being greater lesser desire fight face danger
only expressing known historic facts equations comparing relative significance factor can hope define unknown
ten men battalions divisions fighting fifteen men battalions divisions conquer kill take captive all others themselves losing four one side four other fifteen lost
consequently four equal fifteen therefore 15y
equation does give value unknown factor gives ratio between two unknowns
bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns periods war into such equations series numbers could obtained certain laws should exist might discovered
tactical rule army should act masses when attacking smaller groups retreat unconsciously confirms truth strength army depends spirit
lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only movement masses needed than needed resist attacks
rule leaves out account spirit army continually proves incorrect particularly striking contrast facts when strong rise fall spirit troops occurs all national wars
french retreating 1812 though according tactics should separated into detachments defend themselves congregated into mass spirit army fallen only mass held army together
russians contrary ought according tactics attacked mass fact split into small units their spirit risen separate individuals without orders dealt blows french without needing compulsion induce expose themselves hardships dangers
called partisan war began entry french into smol nsk
before partisan warfare been officially recognized government thousands enemy stragglers marauders foragers been destroyed cossacks peasants killed off instinctively dogs worry stray mad dog death
den dav dov russian instinct first recognize value terrible cudgel regardless rules military science destroyed french belongs credit taking first step toward regularizing method warfare
august dav dov first partisan detachment formed others recognized
further campaign progressed more numerous detachments became
irregulars destroyed great army piecemeal
gathered fallen leaves dropped themselves from withered tree french army sometimes shook tree itself
october when french fleeing toward smol nsk there hundreds such companies various sizes characters
there adopted all army methods infantry artillery staffs comforts life
there also small scratch groups foot horse groups peasants landowners remained unknown
sacristan commanded one party captured several hundred prisoners course month there vas lisa wife village elder slew hundreds french
partisan warfare flamed most fiercely latter days october
first period passed when partisans themselves amazed their own boldness feared every minute surrounded captured french hid forests without unsaddling hardly daring dismount always expecting pursued
end october kind warfare taken definite shape become clear all could ventured against french could 
now only commanders detachments staffs moving according rules distance from french still regarded many things impossible
small bands started their activities long before already observed french closely considered things possible commanders big detachments did dare contemplate
cossacks peasants crept among french now considered everything possible
october den sov one irregulars group height guerrilla enthusiasm
since early morning party been move
all day long been watching from forest skirted highroad large french convoy cavalry baggage russian prisoners separated from rest army learned from spies prisoners moving under strong escort smol nsk
besides den sov lokhov also led small party moved den sov vicinity commanders large divisions staffs also knew convoy den sov expressed sharpening their teeth 
two commanders large parties one pole other german sent invitations den sov almost simultaneously requesting join their divisions attack convoy
bwother gwown mustaches myself said den sov reading documents wrote german despite heartfelt desire serve under valiant renowned generalforgo pleasure already under command polish general
polish general replied same effect informing already under command german
having arranged matters thus den sov lokhov intended without reporting matters higher command attack seize convoy their own small forces
october moving from village mik lino mshevo
left road between mik lino mshevo there large forests extending places road itself though others mile more back from 
through forests den sov party rode all day sometimes keeping well back sometimes coming very edge never losing sight moving french
morning cossacks den sov party seized carried off into forest two wagons loaded cavalry saddles stuck mud far from mik lino where forest ran close road
since until evening party watched movements french without attacking
necessary let french reach mshevo quietly without alarming after joining lokhov come evening consultation watchman hut forest less than mile from mshevo surprise french dawn falling like avalanche their heads from two sides rout capture all one blow
their rear more than mile from mik lino where forest came right road six cossacks posted report fresh columns french should show themselves
beyond mshevo lokhov observe road same way find out distance there other french troops
reckoned convoy fifteen hundred men
den sovtwo hundred lokhov might many more disparity numbers did deter den sov
all now wanted know troops learn capture tongue man from enemy column
morning attack wagons been made hastily frenchmen wagons all been killed only little drummer boy been taken alive straggler could tell nothing definite about troops column
den sov considered dangerous make second attack fear putting whole column alert sent khon shcherb peasant party mshevo try seize least one french quartermasters been sent advance
warm rainy autumn day
sky horizon both color muddy water
times sort mist descended suddenly heavy slanting rain came down
den sov felt cloak sheepskin cap from rain ran down riding thin thoroughbred horse sunken sides

den sov tya rode 
from spot where peasant standing could see french
immediately beyond forest downward slope lay field spring rye
right beyond steep ravine small village landowner house broken roof
village house garden well pond over all rising ground all along road uphill from bridge leading village more than five hundred yards away crowds men could seen through shimmering mist
their russian shouting their horses straining uphill carts their calls one another could clearly heard

when twenty first october general expressed wish send somebody den sov detachment tya begged piteously sent general could refuse
when dispatching recalled tya mad action battle zma where instead riding road place been sent galloped advanced line under fire french there twice fired pistol
now general explicitly forbade taking part action whatever den sov 
why tya blushed grown confused when den sov asked whether could stay
before ridden outskirts forest tya considered must carry out instructions strictly return once
when saw french saw khon learned there would certainly attack night decided rapidity young people change their views general whom greatly respected till rubbishy german den sov hero esaul hero khon hero would shameful leave moment difficulty

arrival lokhov diverted tya attention from drummer boy whom den sov mutton vodka given whom dressed russian coat might kept their band sent away other prisoners
tya heard army many stories lokhov extraordinary bravery cruelty french from moment entered hut tya did take eyes from braced himself more more held head high might unworthy even such company

admit don know sure many there are
hundreds lives may depend there are only two 
besides want very much certainly will don hinder said 
having put french greatcoats shakos tya lokhov rode clearing from den sov reconnoitered french camp emerging from forest pitch darkness descended into hollow
reaching bottom lokhov told cossacks accompanying await there rode quick trot along road bridge
tya heart mouth excitement rode side

cried lokhov suddenly flaring riding straight sentinel
without waiting answer from sentinel stepped aside lokhov rode incline walk
noticing black outline man crossing road lokhov stopped inquired where commander officers 
man soldier sack over shoulder stopped came close lokhov horse touched hand explained simply friendly way commander officers higher hill right courtyard farm called landowner house
having ridden road both sides french talk could heard around campfires lokhov turned into courtyard landowner house

lokhov remarked cossacks danger only stragglers such companion himself probably would dare attack large detachments added inquiringly
well now come away tya thought every moment stood campfire listening talk
lokhov restarted conversation dropped began putting direct questions many men there battalion many battalions many prisoners
asking about russian prisoners detachment lokhov said horrid business dragging corpses about one would better shoot such rabble burst into loud laughter strange tya thought french would immediately detect their disguise involuntarily took step back from campfire
one replied word lokhov laughter french officer whom could see lay wrapped greatcoat rose whispered something companion

near watchman hut black shapes cossacks shanties horses tethered together could seen
behind hut dark shapes two wagons their horses beside discernible hollow dying campfire gleamed red
all cossacks hussars asleep there amid sounds falling drops munching horses near could heard low voices seemed whispering
tya came out peered into darkness went wagons
someone snoring under around stood saddled horses munching their oats

fast asleep after fright
glad after tya remained silent long time listening sounds
heard footsteps darkness black figure appeared

right said man whom tya took hussar
cupleft there wheel hussar took cup
must daylight soon said yawning went away
tya ought known forest den sov guerrilla band less than mile from road sitting wagon captured from french beside horses tethered under likhach sitting sharpening saber big dark blotch right watchman hut red blotch below left dying embers campfire man come cup hussar wanted drink neither knew nor waited know anything all 
fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality
big dark blotch might really watchman hut might cavern leading very depths earth
perhaps red spot fire might eye enormous monster
perhaps really sitting wagon might very well sitting wagon terribly high tower from fell would fall whole day whole month falling never reach bottom
perhaps just cossack likhach sitting under wagon might kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man world whom one knew 
might really been hussar came water went back into hollow perhaps simply vanished disappeared altogether dissolved into nothingness
nothing tya could seen now would surprised 
fairy kingdom where everything possible
looked sky
sky fairy realm like earth
clearing over tops trees clouds swiftly sailing unveiling stars
sometimes looked clouds passing clear black sky appeared
sometimes seemed black spaces clouds
sometimes sky seemed rising high high overhead seemed sink low one could touch one hand
tya eyes began close swayed little
trees dripping
horses neighed jostled one another
ozheg zhegozheg zheg
hissed saber against whetstone suddenly tya heard harmonious orchestra playing unknown sweetly solemn hymn
tya musical nat sha more than nicholas never learned music thought about melody unexpectedly came mind seemed particularly fresh attractive
melody grew passed from one instrument another
played fugue though tya least conception fugue 
each instrument now resembling violin now horn better clearer than violin horn played own part before finished melody merged another instrument began almost same air third fourth all blended into one again became separate again blended now into solemn church music now into something dazzlingly brilliant triumphant
why dream tya said himself lurched forward
well music now 
closed eyes from all sides from distance sounds fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended again all mingled into same sweet solemn hymn
delightful much like like said tya himself
tried conduct enormous orchestra
now softly softly die away sounds obeyed 
now fuller more joyful
still more more joyful from unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds
now voices join ordered tya
first from afar heard men voices women 
voices grew harmonious triumphant strength tya listened their surpassing beauty awe joy
solemn triumphal march there mingled song drip from trees hissing saber ozheg zhegzheg
again horses jostled one another neighed disturbing choir joining 
tya did know long lasted enjoyed himself all time wondered enjoyment regretted there one share 
awakened likhach kindly voice
ready your honor can split frenchman half tya woke 
getting light really getting light exclaimed
horses previously been invisible could now seen their very tails watery light showed itself through bare branches
tya shook himself jumped took ruble from pocket gave likhach flourished saber tested sheathed 
cossacks untying their horses tightening their saddle girths
commander said likhach 
den sov came out watchman hut having called tya gave orders get ready
men rapidly picked out their horses semidarkness tightened their saddle girths formed companies
den sov stood watchman hut giving final orders
infantry detachment passed along road quickly disappeared amid trees mist early dawn hundreds feet splashing through mud
esaul gave orders men
tya held horse bridle impatiently awaiting order mount
face having been bathed cold water all aglow eyes particularly brilliant
cold shivers ran down spine whole body pulsed rhythmically
well wything weady asked den sov
horses brought
den sov angry cossack saddle girths slack reproved mounted
tya put foot stirrup
horse habit made nip leg tya leaped quickly into saddle unconscious own weight turning look hussars starting darkness behind rode den sov
vas trich entrust commission please
god sake
den sov seemed forgotten tya very existence
turned glance 
ask one thing said sternly obey shove yourself forward anywhere
did say another word tya rode silence all way
when come edge forest noticeably growing light over field
den sovtalked whispers esaul cossacks rode past tya den sov
when all ridden den sov touched horse rode down hill
slipping onto their haunches sliding horses descended their riders into ravine
tya rode beside den sov pulsation body constantly increasing
getting lighter lighter mist still hid distant objects
having reached valley den sov looked back nodded cossack beside 
signal said 
cossack raised arm shot rang out
instant tramp horses galloping forward heard shouts came from various sides more shots
first sound trampling hoofs shouting tya lashed horse loosening rein galloped forward heeding den sov shouted 
seemed tya moment shot fired suddenly became bright noon
cossacks galloping along road front 
bridge collided cossack fallen behind galloped 
front soldiers probably frenchmen running from right left across road
one fell mud under horse feet
cossacks crowding about hut busy something
from midst crowd terrible screams arose
tya galloped first thing saw pale face trembling jaw frenchman clutching handle lance been aimed 
hurrah 
ours shouted tya giving rein excited horse galloped forward along village street
could hear shooting ahead 
cossacks hussars ragged russian prisoners come running from both sides road shouting something loudly incoherently
gallant looking frenchman blue overcoat capless frowning red face been defending himself against hussars
when tya galloped frenchman already fallen
late again flashed through tya mind galloped place from rapid firing could heard
shots came from yard landowner house visited night before lokhov
french making stand there behind wattle fence garden thickly overgrown bushes firing cossacks crowded gateway
through smoke approached gate tya saw lokhov whose face pale greenish tint shouting men
round wait infantry exclaimed tya rode 
wait 
hurrah shouted tya without pausing moment galloped place whence came sounds firing where smoke thickest
volley heard bullets whistled past others plashed against something
cossacks lokhov galloped after tya into gateway courtyard
dense wavering smoke french threw down their arms ran out bushes meet cossacks others ran down hill toward pond
tya galloping along courtyard instead holding reins waved both arms about rapidly strangely slipping farther farther one side saddle
horse having galloped campfire smoldering morning light stopped suddenly tya fell heavily wet ground
cossacks saw arms legs jerked rapidly though head quite motionless
bullet pierced skull
after speaking senior french officer came out house white handkerchief tied sword announced surrendered lokhov dismounted went tya lay motionless outstretched arms
done said frown went gate meet den sov riding toward 
killed cried den sov recognizing from distance unmistakably lifeless attitude very familiar tya body lying
done repeated lokhov utterance words afforded pleasure went quickly prisoners surrounded cossacks hurried 
won take called out den sov
den sov did reply rode tya dismounted trembling hands turned toward himself bloodstained mud bespattered face already gone white
used something sweet
take all recalled tya words
cossacks looked round surprise sound like yelp dog den sov turned away walked wattle fence seized hold 
among russian prisoners rescued den sov lokhov pierre bez khov
during whole their march from moscow fresh orders been issued french authorities concerning party prisoners among whom pierre
twenty second october party longer same troops baggage trains left moscow
half wagons laden hardtack traveled first stages been captured cossacks other half gone ahead
one those dismounted cavalrymen marched front prisoners left all disappeared
artillery prisoners seen front during first days now replaced marshal junot enormous baggage train convoyed westphalians
behind prisoners came cavalry baggage train
from zma onwards french army till moved three columns went single group
symptoms disorder pierre noticed their first halting place after leaving moscow now reached utmost limit
road along moved bordered both sides dead horses ragged men fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about now joining moving column now again lagging behind 
several times during march false alarms been given soldiers escort raised their muskets fired run headlong crushing one another afterwards reassembled abused each other their causeless panic
three groups traveling together cavalry stores convoy prisoners junot baggage train still constituted separate united whole though each groups rapidly melting away
artillery baggage train consisted hundred twenty wagons more than sixty now remained rest been captured left behind
junot wagons also been captured abandoned
three wagons been raided robbed stragglers from davout corps
from talk germans pierre learned larger guard been allotted baggage train than prisoners one their comrades german soldier been shot marshal own order silver spoon belonging marshal been found possession
group prisoners melted away most all
three hundred thirty men set out from moscow fewer than hundred now remained
prisoners more burdensome escort than even cavalry saddles junot baggage
understood saddles junot spoon might use cold hungry soldiers should stand guard equally cold hungry russians froze lagged behind road case order shoot merely incomprehensible revolting
escort afraid grievous condition themselves giving way pity felt prisoners rendering their own plight still worse treated particular moroseness severity
dorogob soldiers convoy after locking prisoners stable gone off pillage their own stores several soldier prisoners tunneled under wall ran away recaptured french shot
arrangement adopted when started officer prisoners should kept separate from rest long since been abandoned
all could walk went together after third stage pierre rejoined karat gray blue bandy legged dog chosen karat master
third day after leaving moscow karat again fell ill fever suffered from hospital moscow grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from 
pierre did know why since karat begun grow weaker cost effort near 
when did heard subdued moaning karat generally lay down halting places when smelled odor emanating from now stronger than before pierre moved farther away did think about 
imprisoned shed pierre learned intellect whole being life itself man created happiness happiness within satisfaction simple human needs all unhappiness arises from privation from superfluity
now during last three weeks march learned still another new consolatory truth nothing world terrible
learned there condition man can happy entirely free there condition need unhappy lack freedom
learned suffering freedom their limits those limits are very near together person bed roses one crumpled petal suffered keenly now sleeping bare damp earth one side growing chilled other warming when put tight dancing shoes suffered just did now when walked bare feet covered sores footgear having long since fallen pieces
discovered when married wife own free will seemed been more free than now when locked night stable
all himself subsequently termed sufferings time scarcely felt worst state bare raw scab covered feet
horseflesh appetizing nourishing saltpeter flavor gunpowder used instead salt even pleasant there great cold always warm walking daytime night there campfires lice devoured warmed body
one thing first hard bear feet
after second day march pierre having examined feet campfire thought would impossible walk when everybody got went along limping when warmed walked without feeling pain though night feet more terrible look than before
however did look now thought other things
only now did pierre realize full strength life man saving power transferring attention from one thing another like safety valve boiler allows superfluous steam blow off when pressure exceeds certain limit
did see did hear shot prisoners lagged behind though more than hundred perished way
did think karat grew weaker every day evidently would soon share fate
harder position became more terrible future more independent position found himself joyful comforting thoughts memories imaginings came 
midday twenty second october pierre going uphill along muddy slippery road looking feet roughness way
occasionally glanced familiar crowd around again feet
former latter alike familiar own
blue gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along side road sometimes proof agility self satisfaction lifting one hind leg hopping along three again going all four rushing bark crows sat carrion
dog merrier sleeker than been moscow
all around lay flesh different animals from men horses various stages decomposition wolves kept off passing men dog could eat all wanted
been raining since morning seemed moment might cease sky clear after short break began raining harder than before
saturated road longer absorbed water ran along ruts streams
pierre walked along looking from side side counting steps threes reckoning off fingers
mentally addressing rain repeated now now pelt harder seemed thinking nothing far down deep within soul occupied something important comforting
something most subtle spiritual deduction from conversation karat day before
their yesterday halting place feeling chilly dying campfire pierre got gone next one burning better
there plat karat sitting covered head all greatcoat vestment telling soldiers effective pleasant though now feeble voice story pierre knew
already past midnight hour when karat usually free fever particularly lively
when pierre reached fire heard plat voice enfeebled illness saw pathetic face brightly lit blaze felt painful prick heart
feeling pity man frightened wished away there other fire pierre sat down trying look plat 
well are asked
grumble sickness god won grant death replied plat once resumed story begun
brothercontinued smile pale emaciated face particularly happy light eyes see brother
pierre long been familiar story
karat told alone half dozen times always specially joyful emotion
well knew pierrenow listened tale something new quiet rapture karat evidently felt told communicated itself also pierre
story old merchantlived good god fearing life family went once zhni fair companion rich merchant
having put inn both went sleep next morning companion found robbed throat cut
bloodstained knife found under old merchant pillow
tried knouted nostrils having been torn off all due form karat put sent hard labor siberia
brother point pierre came ten years more passed 
old man living convict submitting should doing wrong
well one night convicts gathered just are old man among 
began telling each suffering sinned against god
one told taken life another taken two third set house fire another simply been vagrant done nothing
asked old man are being punished daddy dear brothers said being punished own other men sins
killed anyone taken anything mine only helped poorer brothers
merchant dear brothers much property
went tell all about due order
don grieve myself says god seems chastened 
only sorry old wife children old man began weep
now happened group very man killed other merchant
where did happen daddy said
when month asked all about heart began ache
comes old man like falls down feet are perishing daddy says
quite true lads man says being tortured innocently nothing says did deed put knife under your head asleep
forgive daddy says christ sake karat paused smiling joyously gazed into fire drew logs together
old man said god will forgive are all sinners sight
suffer own sins wept bitter tears
well think dear friends karat continued face brightening more more rapturous smile now tell contained chief charm whole meaning story think dear fellows murderer confessed authorities
taken six lives says great sinner most sorry old man
confessed all written down papers sent off due form
place long way off judging one thing another filling papers all due form authorities mean time passed
after tsar decree came set merchant free give compensation been awarded
paper arrived began look old man
where old man been suffering innocently vain paper come from tsar began looking karat lower jaw trembled god already forgiven dead dear fellows karat concluded sat long time silent gazing before smile
pierre soul dimly joyfully filled story itself mysterious significance rapturous joylit karat face told mystic significance joy
vos places suddenly cried voice
pleasant feeling excitement expectation something joyful solemn aroused among soldiers convoy prisoners
from all sides came shouts command from left came smartly dressed cavalrymen good horses passing prisoners trot
expression all faces showed tension people feel approach those authority
prisoners thronged together pushed off road
emperor emperor marshal duke hardly sleek cavalry passed before carriage drawn six gray horses rattled 
pierre caught glimpse man three cornered hat tranquil look handsome plump white face
one marshals
eye fell pierre large striking figure expression frowned looked away pierre thought detected sympathydesire conceal sympathy
general charge stores galloped after carriage red frightened face whipping skinny horse
several officers formed group soldiers crowded round 
their faces all looked excited worried
did say did say pierre heard ask
marshal passing prisoners huddled together crowd pierre saw karat whom yet seen morning
sat short overcoat leaning against birch tree
face besides look joyful emotion worn yesterday telling tale merchant suffered innocently there now expression quiet solemnity
karat looked pierre kindly round eyes now filled tears evidently wishing come near might say something 
made did notice look moved hastily away
when prisoners again went forward pierre looked round
karat still sitting side road under birch tree two frenchmen talking over head
pierre did look round again went limping hill
from behind where karat been sitting came sound shot
pierre heard plainly moment remembered yet finished reckoning many stages still remained smol nsk calculation begun before marshal went 
again started reckoning
two french soldiers ran past pierre one whom carried lowered smoking gun
both looked pale expression their faces one glanced timidly pierre there something resembling seen face young soldier execution
pierre looked soldier remembered two days before man burned shirt drying fire laughed 
behind where karat been sitting dog began howl
stupid beast why howling thought pierre
comrades prisoner soldiers walking beside avoided looking back place where shot been fired dog howling just pierre did there set look all their faces
stores prisoners marshal baggage train stopped village mshevo
pierre went fire ate roast horseflesh lay down back fire immediately fell asleep
again slept done mozh ysk after battle borodin 
again real events mingled dreams again someone another gave expression thoughts even same thoughts been expressed dream mozh ysk
life everything
everything changes moves movement god
there life there joy consciousness divine
harder more blessed than all else love life one sufferingsinnocent sufferings
karat came pierre mind
suddenly saw vividly before long forgotten kindly old man given geography lessons switzerland
wait bit said old man showed pierre globe
globe alive vibrating ball without fixed dimensions
whole surface consisted drops closely pressed together all drops moved changed places sometimes several merging into one sometimes one dividing into many
each drop tried spread out occupy much space possible others striving same compressed sometimes destroyed sometimes merged 
life said old teacher
simple clear thought pierre
did know before god midst each drop tries expand reflect greatest extent
grows merges disappears from surface sinks depths again emerges
there now karat spread out disappeared
understand child said teacher
understand damn shouted voice pierre woke 
lifted himself sat 
frenchman just pushed russian soldier away squatting fire engaged roasting piece meat stuck ramrod
sleeves rolled sinewy hairy red hands their short fingers deftly turned ramrod
brown morose face frowning brows clearly visible glow charcoal
all same muttered turning quickly soldier stood behind 
brigand get away twisting ramrod looked gloomily pierre turned away gazed into darkness
prisoner russian soldier frenchman pushed away sitting near fire patting something hand
looking more closely pierre recognized blue gray dog sitting beside soldier wagging tail
come said pierre
plat began did finish
suddenly simultaneously crowd memories awoke fancy look plat given sat under tree shot heard from spot dog howl guilty faces two frenchmen ran past lowered smoking gun karat absence halt point realizing karat been killed just instant knew why recollection came mind summer evening spent beautiful polish lady veranda house kiev
without linking events day drawing conclusion from pierre closed eyes seeing vision country summertime mingled memories bathing liquid vibrating globe sank into water closed over head
before sunrise awakened shouts loud rapid firing
french soldiers running past 
cossacks one shouted moment later crowd russians surrounded pierre
long time could understand happening 
all around heard comrades sobbing joy
brothers dear fellows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping embraced cossacks hussars
hussars cossacks crowded round prisoners one offered clothes another boots third bread
pierre sobbed sat among could utter word
hugged first soldier approached kissed weeping
lokhov stood gate ruined house letting crowd disarmed frenchmen pass 
french excited all happened talking loudly among themselves passed lokhov gently switched boots whip watched cold glassy eyes boded good became silent
opposite side stood lokhov cossack counting prisoners marking off each hundred chalk line gate
many lokhov asked cossack
second hundred replied cossack
filez filez lokhov kept saying having adopted expression from french when eyes met those prisoners flashed cruel light
den sov bareheaded gloomy face walked behind cossacks carrying body tya rost hole been dug garden
after twenty eighth october when frosts began flight french assumed still more tragic character men freezing roasting themselves death campfires carriages people dressed furs continued drive past carrying away property been stolen emperor kings dukes process flight disintegration french army went essentially before
from moscow zma french army seventy three thousand men reckoning guards did nothing during whole war pillage reduced thirty six thousand though more than five thousand fallen battle
from beginning succeeding terms progression could determined mathematically
french army melted away perished same rate from moscow zma from zma smol nsk from smol nsk ber zina from ber zina lna independently greater lesser intensity cold pursuit barring way other particular conditions
beyond zma french army instead moving three columns huddled together into one mass went end
berthier wrote emperor know far commanding officers allow themselves diverge from truth describing condition army said deem duty report your majesty condition various corps occasion observe during different stages last two three days march
scarcely quarter soldiers remain standards their regiments others off themselves different directions hoping find food escape discipline
general regard smol nsk place where hope recover
during last few days many men been seen throw away their cartridges their arms
such state affairs whatever your ultimate plans may interest your majesty service demands army should rallied smol nsk should first all freed from ineffectives such dismounted cavalry unnecessary baggage artillery material longer proportion present forces
soldiers are worn out hunger fatigue need supplies well few days rest
many died last days road bivouacs
state things continually becoming worse makes one fear unless prompt remedy applied troops will longer under control case engagement
november twenty miles from smol nsk
after staggering into smol nsk seemed promised land french searching food killed one another sacked their own stores when everything been plundered fled farther
all went without knowing whither why going
still less did genius napoleon know one issued orders 
still those about retained their old habits wrote commands letters reports orders day called one another sire mon cousin prince eckm roi naples 
orders reports only paper nothing acted upon could carried out though entitled one another majesties highnesses cousins all felt miserable wretches done much evil now pay
though pretended concerned about army each thinking only himselfget away quickly save himself
movements russian french armies during campaign from moscow back niemen like those game russian blindman buff two players are blindfolded one occasionally rings little bell inform catcher whereabouts
first rings bell fearlessly when gets into tight place runs away quietly can often thinking escape runs straight into opponent arms
first still moving along kal road napoleon armies made their presence known later when reached smol nsk road ran holding clapper their bell tight often thinking escaping ran right into russians
owing rapidity french flight russian pursuit consequent exhaustion horses chief means approximately ascertaining enemy position cavalry scouting available
besides result frequent rapid change position each army even information obtained could delivered time
news received one day enemy been certain positionday before third day when something could been done army already two days march farther quite another position
one army fled other pursued
beyond smol nsk there several different roads available french one would thought during their stay four days might learned where enemy might arranged more advantageous plan undertaken something new
after four days halt mob maneuvers plans again began running along beaten track neither right nor left along old worst road through snoe orsh 
expecting enemy from behind front french separated their flight spread out over distance twenty four hours
front all fled emperor kings dukes
russian army expecting napoleon take road right beyond dnieper only reasonable thing themselves turned right came out onto highroad snoe
game blindman buff french ran into our vanguard
seeing their enemy unexpectedly french fell into confusion stopped short from sudden fright resumed their flight abandoning their comrades farther behind
three days separate portions french armyfirst murat vice king davout ney ran gauntlet russian army
abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage their artillery half their men fled getting past russians night making semicircles right
ney came last been busying himself blowing walls smol nsk nobody way despite unfortunate plight french wished punish floor against hurt themselves
ney corps ten thousand men reached napoleon orsh only one thousand men left having abandoned all rest all cannon having crossed dnieper night stealth wooded spot
from orsh fled farther along road lna still playing blindman buff pursuing army
ber zina again became disorganized many drowned many surrendered those got across river fled farther
their supreme chief donned fur coat having seated himself sleigh galloped alone abandoning companions
others could drove away leaving those could surrender die
campaign consisted flight french during did all could destroy themselves
from time turned onto kal road day their leader fled from army none movements crowd sense
one might thought regarding period campaign historians attributed actions mass will one man would found impossible make story retreat fit their theory
mountains books been written historians about campaign everywhere are described napoleon arrangements maneuvers profound plans guided army well military genius shown marshals
retreat from yarosl vets when free road into well supplied district parallel road open along kut zov afterwards pursued unnecessary retreat along devastated road explained being due profound considerations
similarly profound considerations are given retreat from smol nsk orsh 
heroism snoe described where reported been prepared accept battle take personal command walked about birch stick said assez fait empereur est temps faire ral nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning fate scattered fragments army left behind
are told greatness soul marshals especially ney greatness soul consisting made way night around through forest across dnieper escaped orsh abandoning standards artillery nine tenths men
lastly final departure great emperor from heroic army presented historians something great characteristic genius
even final running away described ordinary languagelowest depth baseness every child taught ashamed even act finds justification historians language
when impossible stretch very elastic threads historical ratiocination farther when actions are clearly contrary all humanity calls right even just historians produce saving conception greatness
greatness seems excludes standards right wrong
great man nothing wrong there atrocity great man can blamed
est grandsay historians there longer exists either good evil only grandgrand
grand characteristic their conception special animals called heroes
napoleon escaping home warm fur coat leaving perish those merely comrades opinion men brought there feels que est grand soul tranquil
sublime saw something sublime himself ridicule pas said 
whole world fifty years been repeating sublime grand napol grand sublime ridicule pas
occurs one admit greatness commensurable standard right wrong merely admit one own nothingness immeasurable meanness
standard good evil given christ human actions are incommensurable
there greatness where simplicity goodness truth are absent
russian reading account last part campaign 1812 experienced uncomfortable feeling regret dissatisfaction perplexity asked himself french all captured destroyed when our three armies surrounded superior numbers when disordered french hungry freezing surrendered crowds when historians relate aim russians stop french cut off capture all russian army when numerically weaker than french given battle borodin did achieve purpose when surrounded french three sides when aim capture can french enormously superior when surrounded superior forces could beat could happen history called name replying questions says occurred kut zov torm sov chichag man man did execute such such maneuvers
why did execute those maneuvers why guilty carrying out prearranged plan tried punished even admitted kut zov chichag others cause russian failures still incomprehensible why position russian army being snoe ber zina both cases superior forces french army marshals kings emperor captured russians aimed 
explanation strange fact given russian military historians effect kut zov hindered attack unfounded know could restrain troops from attacking zma tar tino
why russian army inferior forces withstood enemy full strength borodin defeated snoe ber zina disorganized crowds french when numerically superior aim russians consisted cutting off capturing napoleon marshals aim merely frustrated all attempts attain most shamefully baffled last period campaign quite rightly considered french series victories quite wrongly considered victorious russian historians
russian military historians far submit claims logic must admit conclusion spite their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion forth must reluctantly admit french retreat from moscow series victories napoleon defeats kut zov
putting national vanity entirely aside one feels such conclusion involves contradiction since series french victories brought french complete destruction series russian defeats led total destruction their enemy liberation their country
source contradiction lies fact historians studying events from letters sovereigns generals from memoirs reports projects forth attributed last period war 1812 aim never existed namely cutting off capturing napoleon marshals army
there never could been such aim would been senseless attainment quite impossible
would been senseless first napoleon disorganized army flying from russia all possible speed say doing just every russian desired
use performing various operations french running away fast possibly could secondly would been senseless block passage men whose whole energy directed flight
thirdly would been senseless sacrifice one own troops order destroy french armywithout external interference destroying itself such rate though path blocked could carry across frontier more than actually did december namely hundredth part original army
fourthly would been senseless wish take captive emperor kings dukes whose capture would been highest degree embarrassing russians most adroit diplomatists time joseph maistre others recognized
still more senseless would been wish capture army corps french when our own army melted away half before reaching snoe whole division would been needed convoy corps prisoners when our men always getting full rations prisoners already taken perishing hunger
all profound plans about cutting off capturing napoleon army like plan market gardener when driving out garden cow trampled down beds planted should run gate hit cow head
only thing said excuse gardener would very angry
even could said those drew project suffered from trampled beds
besides fact cutting off napoleon army would been senseless impossible
impossible first experience shows three mile movement columns battlefield never coincides plans probability chichag kut zov wittgenstein effecting junction time appointed place remote tantamount impossibility fact thought kut zov when received plan remarked diversions planned over great distances yield desired results
secondly impossible paralyze momentum napoleon army retiring incomparably greater forces than russians possessed would been required
thirdly impossible military term cut off meaning
one can cut off slice bread army
cut off army bar road quite impossible there always plenty room avoid capture there night when nothing can seen military scientists might convince themselves example snoe ber zina
only possible capture prisoners agree captured just only possible catch swallow settles one hand
men can only taken prisoners surrender according rules strategy tactics germans did
french troops quite rightly did consider suited since death hunger cold awaited flight captivity alike
fourthly chiefly impossible never since world began war been fought under such conditions those obtained 1812 russian army pursuit french strained strength utmost could done more without destroying itself
during movement russian army from tar tino snoe lost fifty thousand sick stragglers number equal population large provincial town
half men fell out army without battle
period campaign when army lacked boots sheepskin coats short provisions without vodka camping out night months snow fifteen degrees frost when there only seven eight hours daylight rest night influence discipline cannot maintained when men taken into region death where discipline fails few hours only battle months where every moment fighting death from hunger cold when half army perished single month period campaign historians tell milor dovich should made flank march such such place torm sov another place chichag should crossed more than knee deep snow somewhere else routed cut off french 
russians half whom died did all could should been done attain end worthy nation are blame other russians sitting warm rooms proposed should impossible
all strange contradiction now difficult understand between facts historical accounts only arises historians dealing matter written history beautiful words sentiments various generals history events
words milor dovich seem very interesting their surmises rewards general received question those fifty thousand men left hospitals graves does even interest does come within range their investigation
yet one need only discard study reports general plans consider movement those hundreds thousands men took direct part events all questions seemed insoluble easily simply receive immediate certain solution
aim cutting off napoleon army never existed except imaginations dozen people
could exist senseless unattainable
people single aim free their land from invasion
aim attained first place itself french ran away only necessary stop their flight
secondly attained guerrilla warfare destroying french thirdly fact large russian army following french ready use strength case their movement stopped
russian army act like whip running animal
experienced driver knew better hold whip raised menace than strike running animal head
when seeing dying animal man feels sense horror substance similar own perishing before eyes
when beloved intimate human being dying besides horror extinction life there severance spiritual wound like physical wound sometimes fatal sometimes heals always aches shrinks external irritating touch
after prince andrew death nat sha princess mary alike felt 
drooping spirit closing their eyes before menacing cloud death overhung dared look life face
carefully guarded their open wounds from rough painful contact
everything carriage passing rapidly street summons dinner maid inquiry dress prepare worse still word insincere feeble sympathy seemed insult painfully irritated wound interrupting necessary quiet both tried listen stern dreadful choir still resounded their imagination hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas instant opened out before 
only when alone together free from such outrage pain
spoke little even one another when did very unimportant matters
both avoided allusion future
admit possibility future seemed insult memory
still more carefully did avoid anything relating dead
seemed lived through experienced could expressed words reference details life infringed majesty sacredness mystery been accomplished before their eyes
continued abstention from speech constant avoidance everything might lead subject halting all sides boundary might mention brought before their minds still greater purity clearness both feeling
pure complete sorrow impossible pure complete joy
princess mary position absolute independent arbiter own fate guardian instructor nephew first called back life from realm sorrow dwelt first fortnight
received letters from relations reply room little nicholas been put damp began cough alp tych came yarosl reports state their affairs advice suggestions should return moscow house vozdv zhenka street remained uninjured needed only slight repairs
life did stand still necessary live
hard princess mary emerge from realm secluded contemplation lived till sorry almost ashamed felt leave nat sha alone yet cares life demanded attention involuntarily yielded 
went through accounts alp tych conferred dessalles about nephew gave orders made preparations journey moscow
nat sha remained alone from time princess mary began making preparations departure held aloof from 
princess mary asked countess let nat sha moscow both parents gladly accepted offer saw their daughter losing strength every day thought change scene advice moscow doctors would good 
going anywhere nat sha replied when proposed 
please just leave alone ran out room difficulty refraining from tears vexation irritation rather than sorrow
after felt herself deserted princes mary alone grief nat sha spent most time room herself sitting huddled feet all corner sofa tearing twisting something slender nervous fingers gazing intently fixedly whatever eyes chanced fall 
solitude exhausted tormented absolute need 
soon anyone entered got quickly changed position expression picked book sewing evidently waiting impatiently intruder 
felt all time might moment penetrate terrible questioning great strength spiritual gaze fixed
one day toward end december nat sha pale thin dressed black woolen gown plaited hair negligently twisted into knot crouched feet all corner sofa nervously crumpling smoothing out end sash looked corner door
gazing direction gone other side life
other side life never before thought formerly seemed far away improbable now nearer more akin more comprehensible than side life where everything either emptiness desolation suffering indignity
gazing where knew could imagine otherwise than been 
now saw again been myt shchi itsa yarosl 
saw face heard voice repeated words own sometimes devised other words might spoken
there lying back armchair velvet cloak leaning head thin pale hand

noticed watching raised eyes began speak seriously one thing would terrible said bind oneself forever suffering man

stopped said terrible know there nothing life suffer greatest happiness took hand pressed pressed terrible evening four days before death
imagination said other tender loving words might said only spoke now love thee 
thee lovelove
said convulsively pressing hands setting teeth desperate effort
overcome sweet sorrow tears already rising eyes suddenly asked herself whom saying 
again everything shrouded hard dry perplexity again strained frown peered toward world where 
now now seemed penetrating mystery
instant when seemed incomprehensible revealing itself loud rattle door handle struck painfully ears
duny sha maid entered room quickly abruptly frightened look face showing concern mistress
come your papa once please said strange excited look
letter finished sob
besides feeling aloofness from everybody nat sha feeling special estrangement from members own family
all father mother nya near familiar commonplace all their words feelings seemed insult world been living late felt merely indifferent regarded hostility
heard duny sha words about peter nich misfortune did grasp 
misfortune misfortune can happen just live their own old quiet commonplace life thought nat sha
entered ballroom father hurriedly coming out mother room
evidently run out room give vent sobs choking 
when saw nat sha waved arms despairingly burst into convulsively painful sobs distorted soft round face

weeping like child quickly shuffling feeble legs chair almost fell into covering face hands
suddenly electric shock seemed run through nat sha whole being
terrible anguish struck heart felt dreadful ache something being torn inside dying
pain immediately followed feeling release from oppressive constraint prevented taking part life
sight father terribly wild cries mother heard through door made immediately forget herself own grief
ran father feebly waved arm pointing mother door
princess mary pale quivering chin came out from room taking nat sha arm said something 
nat sha neither saw nor heard 
went rapid steps pausing door instant struggling herself ran mother
countess lying armchair strange awkward position stretching out beating head against wall
nya maids holding arms

turned toward daughter face wincing pain gazed long

improved looks grown more manly continued countess taking daughter hand
mamma are saying
nat sha more more embracing daughter countess began weep first time
princess mary postponed departure
nya count tried replace nat sha could 
saw alone able restrain mother from unreasoning despair
three weeks nat sha remained constantly motherside sleeping lounge chair room making eat drink talking incessantly mere sound tender caressing tones soothed mother
mother wounded spirit could heal
tya death torn from half life
when news tya death come been fresh vigorous woman fifty month later left room listless old woman taking interest life
same blow almost killed countess second blow restored nat sha life
spiritual wound produced rending spiritual body like physical wound strange may seem just deep wound may heal edges join physical spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only result vital force from within
nat sha wound healed way
thought life ended love mother unexpectedly showed essence life love still active within 
prince andrew last days bound princess mary nat sha together new sorrow brought still closer one another
princess mary put off departure three weeks looked after nat sha been sick child
last weeks passed mother bedroom strained nat sha physical strength
one afternoon noticing nat sha shivering fever princess mary took own room made lie down bed
nat sha lay down when princess mary drawn blinds going away called back
don want sleep mary sit little
are tired try sleep

why did bring away will asking 
much better

mind like does think about yes splendid mary said timidly drawing princess mary hand herself mary mustn think wicked
mary darling love let quite quite friends
nat sha embracing began kissing face hands making princess mary feel shy happy demonstration feelings
from day tender passionate friendship such exists only between women established between princess mary nat sha
continually kissing saying tender things one another spent most their time together
when one went out other became restless hastened rejoin 
together felt more harmony one another than either felt herself when alone
feeling stronger than friendship sprang between exclusive feeling life being possible only each other presence
sometimes silent hours sometimes after already bed would begin talking till morning
spoke most long past

nat sha grown thin pale physically weak all talked about health pleased 
sometimes suddenly overcome fear only death sickness weakness loss good looks involuntarily examined bare arm carefully surprised thinness morning noticed drawn seemed piteous face glass
seemed things must yet dreadfully sad
one day went quickly upstairs found herself out breath
unconsciously immediately invented reason going down testing strength ran upstairs again observing result
another time when called duny sha voice trembled called again though could hear duny sha coming called deep chest tones been wont sing listened attentively herself
did know would believed beneath layer slime covered soul seemed impenetrable delicate young shoots grass already sprouting taking root would cover their living verdure grief weighed down would soon longer seen noticed
wound begun heal from within
end january princess mary left moscow count insisted nat sha going consult doctors
after encounter zma where kut zov been unable hold back troops their anxiety overwhelm cut off enemy farther movement fleeing french russians pursued continued far snoe without battle
flight rapid russian army pursuing french could keep cavalry artillery horses broke down information received movements french never reliable
men russian army worn out continuous marching rate twenty seven miles day could faster
realize degree exhaustion russian army only necessary grasp clearly meaning fact losing more than five thousandkilled wounded after tar tino less than hundred prisoners russian army left place hundred thousandstrong reached snoe only fifty thousand
rapidity russian pursuit just destructive our army flight french theirs
only difference russian army moved voluntarily such threat destruction hung over french sick frenchmen left behind enemy hands sick russians left behind among their own people
chief cause wastage napoleon armyrapidity movement convincing proof corresponding decrease russian army
kut zov far power instead trying check movement french desired petersburg russian armygenerals directed whole activity done tar tino zma hastening easing movement our army
besides since exhaustion enormous diminution army caused rapidity advance become evident another reason slackening pace delaying presented itself kut zov
aim russian army pursue french
road french would take unknown closer our troops trod their heels greater distance cover
only following distance could one cut across zigzag path french
all artful maneuvers suggested our generals meant fresh movements army lengthening marcheswhereas only reasonable aim shorten those marches
end kut zov activity directed during whole campaign from moscow lna casually intermittently consistently never once deviated from 
kut zov felt knew reasoning science whole russian being every russian soldier felt french beaten enemy flying must driven out same time like soldiers realized all hardship march rapidity unparalleled such time year
generals especially foreign ones russian army wished distinguish themselves astonish somebodyreason capture king duke seemed now when battle must horrible senseless very time fight conquer somebody
kut zov merely shrugged shoulders when one after another presented projects maneuvers made those soldiers ill shod insufficiently clad half starved within month without fighting battle dwindled half their number best flight continued would greater distance than already traversed before reached frontier
longing distinguish themselves maneuver overthrow cut off showed itself particularly whenever russians stumbled french army
snoe where expected find one three french columns stumbled instead napoleon himself sixteen thousand men
despite all kut zov efforts avoid ruinous encounter preserve troops massacre broken mob french soldiers worn out russians continued snoe three days
toll wrote disposition first column will march etc
usual nothing happened accord disposition
prince eug rttemberg fired from hill over french crowds running past demanded reinforcements did arrive
french avoiding russians dispersed hid themselves forest night making their way round best could continued their flight
milor dovich said did want know anything about commissariat affairs detachment could never found when wanted chevalier sans peur sans reproche styled himself fond parleys french sent envoys demanding their surrender wasted time did ordered 
give column lads said riding troops pointing out french cavalry
cavalry spurs sabers urging horses could scarcely move trotted much effort column presented say crowd frenchmen stark cold frost bitten starving column been presented threw down arms surrendered long been anxious 
snoe took twenty six thousand prisoners several hundred cannon stick called marshal staff disputed distinguished himself pleased their achievement though much regretted having taken napoleon least marshal hero sort reproached one another especially kut zov having failed 
men carried away their passions blind tools most melancholy law necessity considered themselves heroes imagined accomplishing most noble honorable deed
blamed kut zov said from very beginning campaign prevented their vanquishing napoleon thought nothing satisfying passions would advance from linen factories comfortable there snoe checked advance learning napoleon there quite lost head probable understanding napoleon been bribed 
only did contemporaries carried away their passions talk way posterity history acclaimed napoleon grand kut zov described foreigners crafty dissolute weak old courtier russians something indefinite sort puppet useful only russian name
1812 1813 kut zov openly accused blundering
emperor dissatisfied 
history recently written order highest authorities said kut zov cunning court liar frightened name napoleon blunders snoe ber zina deprived russian army glory complete victory over french
such fate great men grands hommes whom russian mind does acknowledge those rare always solitary individuals discerning will providence submit their personal will 
hatred contempt crowd punish such men discerning higher laws
russian historians strange terrible say napoleon most insignificant tool history never anywhere even exile showed human dignity napoleon object adulation enthusiasm grand
kut zov man from beginning end activity 1812 never once swerving word deed from borodin lna presented example exceptional history self sacrifice present consciousness future importance happening kut zov seems something indefinite pitiful when speaking year 1812 always seem little ashamed
yet difficult imagine historical character whose activity unswervingly directed single aim would difficult imagine aim more worthy more consonant will whole people
still more difficult would find instance history aim historical personage being completely accomplished all kut zov efforts directed 1812
kut zov never talked forty centuries looking down from pyramids sacrifices offered fatherland intended accomplish accomplished general said nothing about himself adopted pose always appeared simplest most ordinary men said simplest most ordinary things
wrote letters daughters madame sta read novels liked society pretty women jested generals officers soldiers never contradicted those tried prove anything 
when count rostopch bridge galloped kut zov personal reproaches having caused destruction moscow said promised abandon moscow without battle kut zov replied shall abandon moscow without battle though moscow already abandoned
when arakch coming from emperor said erm lov ought appointed chief artillery kut zov replied yes just saying myself though moment before said quite contrary
did matter alone amid senseless crowd understood whole tremendous significance happening did matter whether rostopch attributed calamities moscow himself still less could matter appointed chief artillery
merely cases continually did old man experience life reached conviction thoughts words serving their expression are move people use quite meaningless words happened enter head
man heedless words did once during whole time activity utter one word inconsistent single aim toward moved throughout whole war
obviously spite himself very diverse circumstances repeatedly expressed real thoughts bitter conviction would understood
beginning battle borodin from time disagreement those about began alone said battle borodin victory repeated both verbally dispatches reports time death
alone said loss moscow loss russia
reply lauriston proposal peace said there can peace such people will
alone during retreat french said all our maneuvers are useless everything being accomplished itself better than could desire enemy must offered golden bridge neither tar tino zma nor snoe battles necessary must keep force reach frontier would sacrifice single russian ten frenchmen
courtier described lies arakch please emperor alone incurring thereby emperor displeasure said lna carry war beyond frontier useless harmful
nor words alone prove only understood meaning events
actions without smallest deviation all directed one same threefold end brace all strength conflict french defeat drive out russia minimizing far possible sufferings our people our army
procrastinator kut zov whose motto patience time enemy decisive action gave battle borodin investing preparations unparalleled solemnity
kut zov before battle austerlitz began said would lost alone contradiction everyone else declared till death borodin victory despite assurance generals battle lost despite fact army retire after winning battle unprecedented
alone during whole retreat insisted battles useless should fought new war should begun nor frontiers russia crossed
easy now understand significance events only abstain from attributing activity mass aims existed only heads dozen individuals events results now lie before 
did old man alone opposition general opinion truly discern importance people view events all activity never once untrue source extraordinary power penetrating meaning events occuring lay national feeling possessed full purity strength
only recognition fact possessed feeling caused people strange manner contrary tsar wish select old man disfavor their representative national war
only feeling placed highest human pedestal from commander chief devoted all powers slaying destroying men saving showing pity 
simple modest therefore truly great figure could cast false mold european hero supposed ruler men history invented
lackey man can great lackey own conception greatness
fifth november first day called battle snoe
toward evening after much disputing many mistakes made generals did their proper places after adjutants been sent about counterorders when become plain enemy everywhere flight there could would battle kut zov left snoe went broe whither headquarters day been transferred
day clear frosty
kut zov rode broe plump little white horse followed enormous suite discontented generals whispered among themselves behind back
all along road groups french prisoners captured day there seven thousand crowding warm themselves campfires
near broe immense crowd tattered prisoners buzzing talk wrapped bandaged anything been able get hold standing road beside long row unharnessed french guns
approach commander chief buzz talk ceased all eyes fixed kut zov wearing white cap red band padded overcoat bulged round shoulders moved slowly along road white horse
one generals reporting where guns prisoners been captured
kut zov seemed preoccupied did listen general saying
screwed eyes dissatisfied look gazed attentively fixedly prisoners presented specially wretched appearance
most disfigured frost bitten noses cheeks nearly all red swollen festering eyes
one group french stood close road two one whom face covered sores tearing piece raw flesh their hands
there something horrible bestial fleeting glance threw riders malevolent expression after glance kut zov soldier sores immediately turned away went doing
kut zov looked long intently two soldiers
puckered face screwed eyes pensively swayed head
another spot noticed russian soldier laughingly patting frenchman shoulder saying something friendly manner kut zov same expression face again swayed head
saying asked general continuing report directed commander chief attention standards captured from french standing front preobrazh nsk regiment
standards said kut zov evidently detaching himself difficulty from thoughts preoccupied 
looked about absently
thousands eyes looking from all sides awaiting word from 
stopped front preobrazh nsk regiment sighed deeply closed eyes
one suite beckoned soldiers carrying standards advance surround commander chief 
kut zov silent few seconds submitting evident reluctance duty imposed position raised head began speak
looked attentively around circle officers recognizing several 
thank all said addressing soldiers again officers
stillness around slowly uttered words distinctly heard
thank all your hard faithful service
victory complete russia will forget honor forever
paused looked around
lower head lower said soldier accidentally lowered french eagle holding before preobrazh nsk standards
hurrah lads added addressing men rapid movement chin
hur rah roared thousands voices
soldiers shouting kut zov leaned forward saddle bowed head eye lit mild apparently ironic gleam
see brothers
all once voice expression face changed
longer commander chief speaking ordinary old man wanted tell comrades something very important
there stir among throng officers ranks soldiers moved might hear better going say
see brothers know hard can helped bear won long now see our visitors off rest
hard still are home see come said pointing prisoners
strong didn spare ourselves now may even pity 
are human beings 
isn lads looked around direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon read sympathy said
face grew brighter brighter old man mild smile drew corners lips eyes into cluster wrinkles
ceased speaking bowed head perplexity
after all asked serves right bloody bastards cried suddenly lifting head
flourishing whip rode off gallop first time during whole campaign left broken ranks soldiers laughing joyfully shouting hurrah kut zov words hardly understood troops
one could repeated field marshal address begun solemnly changing into old man simplehearted talk hearty sincerity speech feeling majestic triumph combined pity foe consciousness justice our cause exactly expressed old man good natured expletives merely understood lay soul every soldier found expression their joyous long sustained shouts
afterwards when one generals addressed kut zov asking whether wished cal che sent kut zov answering unexpectedly gave sob being evidently greatly moved
when troops reached their night halting place eighth november last day snoe battles already growing dusk
all day been calm frosty occasional lightly falling snow toward evening began clear
through falling snow purple black starry sky showed itself frost grew keener
infantry regiment left tar tino three thousand strong now numbered only nine hundred one first arrive night halting place village highroad
quartermasters met regiment announced all huts full sick dead frenchmen cavalrymen members staff
there only one hut available regimental commander
commander rode hut
regiment passed through village stacked arms front last huts
like huge many limbed animal regiment began prepare lair food
one part dispersed waded knee deep through snow into birch forest right village immediately sound axes swords crashing branches merry voices could heard from there
another section amid regimental wagons horsesstanding group busy getting out caldrons rye biscuit feeding horses

lower stakes cracked more more last wall fell men been pushing 
loud coarse laughter joyous shouts ensued
now catch hold twos hand lever 
where are shoving now all together wait moment boys
song all stood silent soft pleasant velvety voice began sing
end third verse last note died away twenty voices roared out once 
despite their united efforts wattle hardly moved silence followed heavy breathing men audible
sixth company devils are lend hand

twenty mensixth company their way into village joined haulers wattle wall about thirty five feet long seven feet high moved forward along village street swaying pressing upon cutting shoulders gasping men

merry senseless words abuse flowed freely
are suddenly came authoritative voice sergeant major came upon men hauling their burden
there are gentry general himself hut foul mouthed devils brutes give shouted hitting first man came way swinging blow back
can make less noise men became silent
soldier been struck groaned wiped face been scratched till bled falling against wattle
there devil hits out made face all bloody said frightened whisper when sergeant major passed 
don like said laughing voice moderating their tones men moved forward
when out village began talking again loud before interlarding their talk same aimless expletives
hut men passed chief officers gathered animated talk over their tea about events day maneuvers suggested tomorrow
proposed make flank march left cut off vice king murat capture 
time soldiers dragged wattle fence place campfires blazing all sides ready cooking wood crackled snow melting black shadows soldiers flitted fro all over occupied space where snow been trodden down

wattle wall men brought set semicircle eighth company shelter from north propped musket rests campfire built before 
beat tattoo called roll supper settled down round fires night repairing their footgear smoking pipes stripping themselves naked steam lice out their shirts
one would thought under almost incredibly wretched conditions russian soldiers time lacking warm boots sheepskin coats without roof over their heads snow eighteen degrees frost without even full rations commissariat did always keep troops would presented very sad depressing spectacle
contrary army never under best material conditions presented more cheerful animated aspect
all began grow depressed lost strength sifted out army dayday
all physically morally weak long since been left behind only flower army physically mentally remained
more men collected behind wattle fence eighth company than anywhere else
two sergeants major sitting their campfire blazed brighter than others

huge campfire blazing brightly midst snow lighting branches trees heavy hoarfrost
about midnight heard sound steps snow forest crackling dry branches
bear lads said one men
all raised their heads listen out forest into bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging one another
two frenchmen been hiding forest
came fire hoarsely uttering something language our soldiers did understand
one taller than other wore officer hat seemed quite exhausted
approaching fire been going sit down fell
other short sturdy soldier shawl tied round head stronger
raised companion said something pointing mouth
soldiers surrounded frenchmen spread greatcoat ground sick man brought buckwheat porridge vodka both 
exhausted french officer ramballe man head wrapped shawl morel orderly
when morel drunk vodka finished bowl porridge suddenly became unnaturally merry chattered incessantly soldiers could understand 
ramballe refused food resting head elbow lay silent beside campfire looking russian soldiers red vacant eyes
occasionally emitted long drawn groan again became silent
morel pointing shoulders tried impress soldiers fact ramballe officer ought warmed
russian officer come fire sent ask colonel whether would take french officer into hut warm when messenger returned said colonel wished officer brought ramballe told 
rose tried walk staggered would fallen soldier standing held

meanwhile morel sitting best place fire surrounded soldiers
morel short sturdy frenchman inflamed streaming eyes wearing woman cloak shawl tied woman fashion round head over cap

all grew silent
stars knowing one looking began disport themselves dark sky now flaring now vanishing now trembling busy whispering something gladsome mysterious one another
french army melted away uniform rate mathematical progression crossing ber zina about much been written only one intermediate stage destruction all decisive episode campaign
much been still written about ber zina french side only broken bridge across rivercalamities their army been previously enduring suddenly concentrated one moment into tragic spectacle remained every memory russian side merely petersburg far from seat war plan again one pfuel been devised catch napoleon strategic trap ber zina river
everyone assured himself all would happen according plan therefore insisted just crossing ber zina destroyed french army
reality results crossing much less disastrous french guns men lost than snoe been figures show
sole importance crossing ber zina lies fact plainly indubitably proved fallacy all plans cutting off enemy retreat soundness only possible line action one kut zov general mass army demanded namely simply follow enemy 
french crowd fled continually increasing speed all energy directed reaching goal
fled like wounded animal impossible block path
shown much arrangements made crossing took place bridges
when bridges broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow women children french transport all carried vis inerti pressed forward into boats into ice covered water did surrender
impulse reasonable
condition fugitives pursuers equally bad
long remained their own people each might hope help from fellows definite place held among 
those surrendered remaining same pitiful plight would lower level claim share necessities life
french did need informed fact half prisoners whom russians did know perished cold hunger despite their captors desire save felt could otherwise
most compassionate russian commanders those favorable french even frenchmen russian service could nothing prisoners
french perished from conditions russian army itself exposed
impossible take bread clothes from our hungry indispensable soldiers give french though harmful hated guilty simply unnecessary
russians even did exceptions
certain destruction lay behind french front there hope
their ships been burned there salvation save collective flight whole strength french concentrated
farther fled more wretched became plight remnant especially after ber zina consequence petersburg plan special hopes been placed russians keener grew passions russian commanders blamed one another kut zov most all
anticipation failure petersburg ber zina plan would attributed kut zov led dissatisfaction contempt ridicule more more strongly expressed
ridicule contempt course expressed respectful form making impossible ask wherein blame
did talk seriously when reporting asking sanction appeared fulfilling regrettable formality winked behind back tried mislead every turn
could understand all people assumed useless talk old man would never grasp profundity their plans would answer phrases thought mere phrases about golden bridge about impossibility crossing frontier crowd tatterdemalions forth
heard all before
all said necessary await provisions men boots simple proposed complicated clever evident old stupid though power commanders genius
after junction army brilliant admiral petersburg hero wittgenstein mood gossip staff reached their maximum
kut zov saw merely sighed shrugged shoulders
only once after affair ber zina did get angry write bennigsen reported separately emperor following letter account your spells ill health will your excellency please good set off kal receipt there await further commands appointments from imperial majesty
after bennigsen departure grand duke tsar vich constantine vlovich joined army
taken part beginning campaign subsequently been removed from army kut zov
now having come army informed kut zov emperor displeasure poor success our forces slowness their advance
emperor intended join army personally few days time
old man experienced court well military affairs same kut zov august been chosen commander chief against sovereign wishes removed grand duke heir apparent from army own authority contrary emperor will decided abandonment moscow now realized once day over part played power supposed hold longer 
understood merely from attitude court
saw one hand military business played part ended felt mission accomplished same time began conscious physical weariness aged body necessity physical rest
twenty ninth november kut zov entered lna dear lna called 
twice during career kut zov been governor lna
wealthy town been injured found old friends associations besides comforts life long been deprived
suddenly turned from cares army state far passions seethed around allowed immersed himself quiet life formerly been accustomed alltaking place allstill done realm history did concern all
chichag one most zealous cutters off breakers first wanted effect diversion greece warsaw never wished where sent chichag noted boldness spoke emperor considered kut zov under obligation when sent make peace turkey 1811 independently kut zov found peace already been concluded admitted emperor merit securing peace really kut zov chichag first meet kut zov castle where latter stay
undress naval uniform dirk holding cap under arm handed kut zov garrison report keys town
contemptuously respectful attitude younger men old man dotage expressed highest degree behavior chichag knew accusations being directed against kut zov
when speaking chichag kut zov incidentally mentioned vehicles packed china been captured from bor sov been recovered would restored 
mean imply nothing eat out 
contrary can supply everything even want give dinner parties warmly replied chichag tried every word spoke prove own rectitude therefore imagined kut zov animated same desire
kut zov shrugging shoulders replied subtle penetrating smile meant merely say said
contrary emperor wish kut zov detained greater part army lna
those about said became extraordinarily slack physically feeble during stay town
attended army affairs reluctantly left everything generals awaiting emperor arrival led dissipated life
having left petersburg seventh december suite count tolst prince volk nski arakch others emperor reached lna eleventh traveling sleigh drove straight castle
spite severe frost hundred generals staff officers full parade uniform stood front castle well guard honor sem nov regiment
courier galloped castle advance troyka three foam flecked horses shouted coming konovn tsyn rushed into vestibule inform kut zov waiting hall porter little lodge
minute later old man large stout figure full dress uniform chest covered orders scarf drawn round stomach waddled out into porch
put hat peaks sides holding gloves hand walking effort sideways down steps level street took hand report prepared emperor
there running fro whispering another troyka flew furiously all eyes turned approaching sleigh figures emperor volk nski could already descried
from habit fifty years all physically agitating effect old general
carefully hastily felt himself all over readjusted hat pulling himself together drew himself very moment when emperor having alighted from sleigh lifted eyes handed report began speaking smooth ingratiating voice
emperor rapid glance scanned kut zov from head foot frowned instant immediately mastering himself went old man extended arms embraced 
embrace owing long standing impression related innermost feelings usual effect kut zov gave sob

when came himself after illness saw attendance two servants ter nty ska come from moscow also cousin eldest princess been living estate hearing rescue illness come look after 
only gradually during convalescence pierre lost impressions become accustomed during last few months got used idea one would oblige anywhere tomorrow one would deprive warm bed would sure get dinner tea supper
long time dreams still saw himself conditions captivity
same way little little came understand news been told after rescue about death prince andrew death wife destruction french
joyous feeling freedom complete inalienable freedom natural man first experienced first halt outside moscow filled pierre soul during convalescence
surprised find inner freedom independent external conditions now additional setting external liberty
alone strange town without acquaintances
one demanded anything sent anywhere
all wanted thought wife been continual torment longer there since more
good splendid said himself when cleanly laid table moved savory beef tea when lay down night soft clean bed when remembered french gone wife more
good splendid old habit asked himself question well going immediately gave himself answer well shall live
splendid very question formerly tormented thing continually sought find aim life longer existed now
search aim life merely disappeared temporarily felt longer existed could present itself again
very absence aim gave complete joyous sense freedom constituted happiness time
could see aim now faith faith kind rule words ideas faith ever living ever manifest god
formerly sought aims set himself
search aim been simply search god suddenly captivity learned words reasoning direct feeling nurse told long ago god everywhere
captivity learned karat god greater more infinite unfathomable than architect universe recognized freemasons
felt like man after straining eyes see into far distance finds sought very feet
all life looked over heads men around when should merely looked front without straining eyes
past never been able find great inscrutable infinite something
only felt must exist somewhere looked 
everything near comprehensible seen only limited petty commonplace senseless
equipped himself mental telescope looked into remote space where petty worldliness hiding itself misty distance seemed great infinite merely clearly seen
such european life politics freemasonry philosophy philanthropy seemed 
even moments weakness accounted mind penetrated those distances there seen same pettiness worldliness senselessness
now however learned see great eternal infinite everything therefore see enjoy contemplation naturally threw away telescope through till now gazed over men heads gladly regarded ever changing eternally great unfathomable infinite life around

external ways pierre hardly changed all
appearance just used 
before absent minded seemed occupied before eyes something special own
difference between former present self formerly when did grasp lay before said puckered forehead painfully vainly seeking distinguish something distance
present still forgot said still did see before eyes now looked scarcely perceptible seemingly ironic smile before listened said though evidently seeing hearing something quite different
formerly appeared kindhearted unhappy man people been inclined avoid 
now smile joy life always played round lips sympathy others shone eyes questioning look whether contented people felt pleased presence
previously talked great deal grew excited when talked seldom listened now seldom carried away conversation knew listen people readily told their most intimate secrets
princess never liked pierre been particularly hostile since felt herself under obligations after old count death now after staying short time where come intending show pierre spite ingratitude considered duty nurse felt surprise vexation become fond 
pierre did way seek approval merely studied interest
formerly felt regarded indifference irony shrunk into herself did others shown only combative side nature now seemed trying understand most intimate places heart mistrustfully first afterwards gratefully let see hidden kindly sides character
most cunning man could crept into confidence more successfully evoking memories best times youth showing sympathy 
yet pierre cunning consisted simply finding pleasure drawing out human qualities embittered hard own way proud princess
yes very very kind man when under influence bad people people such myself thought 
servants ter nty ska their own way noticed change taken place pierre
considered become much simpler
ter nty when helped undress wished good night often lingered master boots hands clothes over arm see whether would start talk

doctor attended pierre visited every day though considered duty doctor pose man whose every moment value suffering humanity would sit hours pierre telling favorite anecdotes observations characters patients general especially ladies
pleasure talk man like like our provincials would say
there several prisoners from french army doctor brought one young italian see pierre
officer began visiting pierre princess used make fun tenderness italian expressed 
italian seemed happy only when could come see pierre talk tell about past life home love pour out indignation against french especially against napoleon
all russians are least like sacrilege fight such nation said pierre

formerly all pecuniary questions especially requests money extremely wealthy man very exposed produced state hopeless agitation perplexity
give give asked himself
needs 
needs most perhaps are both impostors old days been unable find way out all surmises given all asked long anything give
formerly been similar state perplexity regard every question concerning property when one person advised one thing another something else

nat sha without waiting princess mary finish again looked inquiringly pierre
pierre continued only one believes there god ruling can bear loss such hers 
nat sha already opened mouth speak suddenly stopped
pierre hurriedly turned away from again addressed princess mary asking about friend last days
pierre confusion now almost vanished same time felt freedom also completely gone

did purposely say things please whatever saying regarded from standpoint
princess mary reluctantly usual such cases began telling condition found prince andrew

wished take leave princess mary would let 
nat sha sometimes don sleep till after two please don 
before pierre left room princess mary told first time talked like 
pierre shown into large brightly lit dining room few minutes later heard footsteps princess mary entered nat sha
nat sha calm though severe grave expression again settled face
all three now experienced feeling awkwardness usually follows after serious heartfelt talk
impossible back same conversation talk trifles awkward yet desire speak there silence seems like affectation
went silently table
footmen drew back chairs pushed again
pierre unfolded cold table napkin resolving break silence looked nat sha princess mary
evidently both formed same resolution eyes both shone satisfaction confession besides sorrow life also joy
take vodka count asked princess mary those words suddenly banished shadows past

nat sha without knowing all attention did lose word single quiver pierre voice look twitch muscle face nor single gesture
caught unfinished word flight took straight into open heart divining secret meaning all pierre mental travail
princess mary understood story sympathized now saw something else absorbed all attention
saw possibility love happiness between nat sha pierre first thought filled heart gladness
three clock morning
footmen came sad stern faces change candles one noticed

same mischievous smile lingered long time face been forgotten there
long time before pierre could fall asleep night

thinking prince andrew nat sha their love one moment jealous past reproaching himself feeling
already six morning still paced down room
well done cannot avoided done evidently said himself hastily undressing got into bed happy agitated free from hesitation indecision
strange impossible such happiness seems must everything may man wife told himself

kind pleasant face smiles looks 
pierre went princess mary dinner
drove through streets past houses been burned down surprised beauty those ruins
picturesqueness chimney stacks tumble down walls burned out quarters town stretching out concealing one another reminded rhine colosseum
cabmen met their passengers carpenters cutting timber new houses axes women hawkers shopkeepers all looked cheerful beaming eyes seemed say there let see will come entrance princess mary house pierre felt doubtful whether really been there night before really seen nat sha talked 
perhaps imagined perhaps shall find one there
hardly entered room before felt presence whole being loss sense freedom
same black dress soft folds hair done same way day before yet quite different
been like when entered day before could moment failed recognize 
known almost child later prince andrew fianc 
bright questioning light shone eyes face friendly strangely roguish expression
pierre dined would spent whole evening there princess mary going vespers pierre left house 
next day came early dined stayed whole evening
though princess mary nat sha evidently glad see their visitor though all pierre interest now centered house evening talked over everything conversation passed from one trivial topic another repeatedly broke off
stayed long princess mary nat sha exchanged glances evidently wondering when would 
felt uneasy embarrassed sat simply could get take leave
princess mary foreseeing end rose first complaining headache began say good night
are going petersburg tomorrow asked
going pierre replied hastily surprised tone though offended
petersburg tomorrow won say good yet
will call round case commissions said standing before princess mary turning red taking departure
nat sha gave hand went out
princess mary other hand instead going away sank into armchair looked sternly intently deep radiant eyes
weariness plainly shown before now quite passed off
deep long drawn sigh seemed prepared lengthy talk
when nat sha left room pierre confusion awkwardness immediately vanished replaced eager excitement
quickly moved armchair toward princess mary
yes wanted tell said answering look spoken
princess help can hope princess dear friend listen know all
know worthy know impossible speak now
don can 
paused rubbed face eyes hands
well went evident effort self control coherence
don know when began love loved alone all life love cannot imagine life without 
cannot propose present thought perhaps might someday wife may missing possibility
tell can hope tell dear princess added after pause touched hand did reply
thinking told answered princess mary
will say

princess mary stopped
going say speak love impossible stopped seen sudden change nat sha two days before would only hurt pierre spoke love very thing wished 
speak now wouldn said princess all same
leave said princess mary
pierre looking into princess mary eyes
well 
know loves
before words out pierre sprung frightened expression seized princess mary hand
makes thinkthinkmay hope think
yes think said princess mary smile
write parents leave 
wish happen heart tells will
cannot happy can 
happy can pierre kept saying kissed princess mary hands
petersburg will best
will write said
petersburg there very well 
may come again tomorrow next day pierre came say good 
nat sha less animated than been day before day looked pierre sometimes felt vanishing neither nor existed longer nothing existed happiness
possible can told himself every look gesture word filled soul joy
when saying good took thin slender hand could help holding little longer own
possible hand face those eyes all treasure feminine charm strange now possible will one day mine forever familiar myself 
impossible 
good count said aloud
shall look forward very much your return added whisper
simple words look expression face accompanied formed two months subject inexhaustible memories interpretations happy meditations pierre
shall look forward very much your return
yes yes did say yes shall look forward very much your return
happy happening happy said pierre himself
there nothing pierre soul now all like troubled during courtship 
did repeat himself sickening feeling shame words spoken say why did say whatever made say vous aime contrary now repeated imagination every word nat sha spoken pictured every detail face smile did wish diminish add anything only repeat againagain
there now shadow doubt mind whether undertaken right wrong
only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed mind wasn all dream isn princess mary mistaken conceited self confident believe all suddenly princess mary will tell will sure smile say strange must deluding himself
doesn know man just man 
something altogether different higher
only doubt often troubling pierre
did now make plans
happiness before appeared inconceivable only could attain would end all things
everything ended 
joyful unexpected frenzy thought himself incapable possessed 
whole meaning life alone whole world seemed centered love possibility being loved 
times everybody seemed occupied one thing only future happiness
sometimes seemed other people all pleased himself merely tried hide pleasure pretending busy other interests
every word gesture saw allusions happiness
often surprised those met significantly happy looks smiles seemed express secret understanding between 
when realized people might aware happiness pitied whole heart felt desire somehow explain all occupied mere frivolous trifle unworthy attention
when suggested should enter civil service when war general political affairs discussed assumption everybody welfare depended issue events would listen mild pitying smile surprise people strange comments
time saw everybody both those imagined understood real meaning life feeling those unfortunates evidently did understand bright light emotion shone within himself once without effort saw everyone met everything good worthy being loved
when dealing affairs papers dead wife memory aroused feeling pity known bliss now knew
prince vas having obtained new post fresh decorations particularly proud time seemed pathetic kindly old man much pitied
often afterlife pierre recalled period blissful insanity
all views formed men circumstances time remained true always
only did renounce subsequently when doubt inwardly variance referred views held time madness always proved correct
may appeared strange queer thought mad seemed
contrary wiser more insight than other time understood all worth understanding life 
pierre insanity consisted waiting used discover personal attributes termed good qualities people before loving heart now overflowing love loving people without cause discovered indubitable causes loving

why are crying happy your sake said princess mary those tears quite forgave nat sha joy

think fun will when wife marry nicholas nat sha asked speak 
silent awhile
why petersburg nat sha suddenly asked hastily replied own question
seven years passed
storm tossed sea european history subsided within shores seemed become calm
mysterious forces move humanity mysterious laws their motion are unknown continued operate
though surface sea history seemed motionless movement humanity went unceasingly flow time
various groups people formed dissolved coming formation dissolution kingdoms displacement peoples course preparation
sea history driven spasmodically from shore shore previously
historic figures borne waves from one shore another before
now seemed rotate one spot
historical figures head armies formerly reflected movement masses ordering wars campaigns battles now reflected restless movement political diplomatic combinations laws treaties
historians call activity historical figures reaction
dealing period sternly condemn historical personages their opinion caused describe reaction
all well known people period from alexander napoleon madame sta photius schelling fichte chateaubriand rest pass before their stern judgment seat are acquitted condemned according whether conduced progress reaction
according their accounts reaction took place time russiaalso chief culprit alexander same man according chief cause liberal movement commencement reign being savior russia
there one russian literature now from schoolboy essayist learned historian does throw little stone alexander things did wrong period reign
ought acted wayway
case did well case badly
behaved admirably beginning reign during 1812 acted badly giving constitution poland forming holy alliance entrusting power arakch favoring gol tsyn mysticism afterwards shishk photius
also acted badly concerning himself active army disbanding sem nov regiment
would take dozen pages enumerate all reproaches historians address based their knowledge good humanity
reproaches mean very actions historians praise alexander liberal attempts beginning reign struggle napoleon firmness displayed 1812 campaign 1813 flow from same sources circumstances birth education life made personality from actions blame holy alliance restoration poland reaction 1820 later also flowed does substance those reproaches lie lies fact historic character like alexander standing highest possible pinnacle human power blinding light history focused upon character exposed those strongest all influences intrigues flattery self deception inseparable from power character every moment life felt responsibility all happening europe fictitious live character like every man personal habits passions impulses toward goodness beauty truth character though lacking virtue historians accuse same conception welfare humanity fifty years ago present day professor from youth upwards been occupied learning books lectures taking notes from 
even assume fifty years ago alexander mistaken view good people must inevitably assume historian judges alexander will also after lapse time turn out mistaken view good humanity
assumption all more natural inevitable watching movement history see every year each new writer opinion good mankind changes once seemed good ten years later seems bad vice versa
more find one same time quite contradictory views bad good history people regard giving constitution poland forming holy alliance praiseworthy alexander others regard blameworthy
activity alexander napoleon cannot called useful harmfulimpossible say useful harmful
activity displeases somebody only does agree limited understanding good
whether preservation father house moscow glory russian arms prosperity petersburg other universities freedom poland greatness russia balance power europe certain kind european culture called progress appear good bad must admit besides things action every historic character other more general purposes inaccessible 
let assume called science can harmonize all contradictions possesses unchanging standard good bad try historic characters events let say alexander could done everything differently let say guidance from those blame profess know ultimate aim movement humanity might arranged matters according program present accusers would given nationality freedom equality progress think cover ground 
let assume program possible been formulated alexander acted 
would become activity all those opposed tendency prevailed government activity opinion historians good beneficent their activity would existed there would been life there would been nothing
admit human life can ruled reason possibility life destroyed
assume historians great men lead humanity attainment certain ends greatness russia france balance power europe diffusion ideas revolution general progress anything else impossible explain facts history without introducing conceptions chance genius
aim european wars beginning nineteenth century been aggrandizement russia aim might been accomplished without all preceding wars without invasion
aim aggrandizement france might been attained without revolution without empire
aim dissemination ideas printing press could accomplished much better than warfare
aim progress civilization easy see there are other ways diffusing civilization more expedient than destruction wealth human lives
why did happen other way happened chance created situation genius utilized says history
chance genius words chance genius denote really existing thing therefore cannot defined
those words only denote certain stage understanding phenomena
know why certain event occurs think cannot know try know talk about chance
see force producing effects beyond scope ordinary human agencies understand why occurs talk genius
herd rams ram herdsman drives each evening into special enclosure feed becomes twice fat others must seem genius
must appear astonishing conjunction genius whole series extraordinary chances ram instead getting into general fold every evening goes into special enclosure where there are oats very ram swelling fat killed meat
rams need only cease suppose all happens happens solely attainment their sheepish aims need only admit happens may also purposes beyond their ken will once perceive unity coherence happened ram fattened
even know purpose are fattened will least know all happened ram did happen accidentally will longer need conceptions chance genius
only renouncing our claim discern purpose immediately intelligible admitting ultimate purpose beyond our ken may discern sequence experiences lives historic characters perceive cause effect produce incommensurable ordinary human capabilities words chance genius become superfluous
need only confess know purpose european convulsions know only facts murders first france italy africa prussia austria spain russia movements from west east from east west form essence purpose events only shall need see exceptional ability genius napoleon alexander shall unable consider anything like other men shall obliged recourse chance explanation those small events made people will clear all those small events inevitable
discarding claim knowledge ultimate purpose shall clearly perceive just one cannot imagine blossom seed single plant better suited than those produces impossible imagine two people more completely adapted down smallest detail purpose fulfill than napoleon alexander all their antecedents
fundamental essential significance european events beginning nineteenth century lies movement mass european peoples from westeast afterwards from east west
commencement movement movement from west east
peoples west able make their warlike movementmoscow necessary should form themselves into military group size able endure collision warlike military group east should abandon all established traditions customs during their military movementshould their head man could justify himself deceptions robberies murders would committed during movement
beginning french revolution old inadequately large group destroyed well old habits traditions step step group formed larger dimensions new customs traditions man produced would stand head coming movement bear responsibility all done
man without convictions without habits without traditions without name even frenchman emerges seem strangest chances from among all seething french parties without joining one borne forward prominent position
ignorance colleagues weakness insignificance opponents frankness falsehoods dazzling self confident limitations man raise head army

impregnable malta surrenders without shot most reckless schemes are crowned success
enemy fleet subsequently did let single boat pass allows entire army elude 
africa whole series outrages are committed against almost unarmed inhabitants

winter 1813 nicholas married princess mary moved bald hills wife mother nya
within four years paid off all remaining debts without selling wife property having received small inheritance death cousin paid debt pierre well
another three years 1820 managed affairs able buy small estate adjoining bald hills negotiating buy back otr dnoe being pet dream
having started farming from necessity soon grew devoted became favorite almost sole occupation
nicholas plain farmer did like innovations especially english ones coming into vogue
laughed theoretical treatises estatemanagement disliked factories raising expensive products buying expensive seed corn did make hobby particular part work estate
always before mind eye estate whole particular part 
chief thing eyes nitrogen soil nor oxygen air nor manures nor special plows most important agent nitrogen oxygen manure plow made effective peasant laborer
when nicholas first began farming began understand different branches serf especially attracted attention
peasant seemed merely tool also judge farming end himself
first watched serfs trying understand their aims considered good badonly pretended direct give orders reality learning from their methods their manner speech their judgment good bad
only when understood peasants tastes aspirations learned talk their language grasp hidden meaning their words felt akin did begin boldly manage serfs perform toward duties demanded 
guided gift insight taking management estates once unerringly appointed bailiff village elder delegate very men serfs would themselves chosen right choose posts never changed hands
before analyzing properties manure before entering into debit credit ironically called found out many cattle peasants increased number all possible means
kept peasant families together largest groups possible allowing family groups divide into separate households
hard alike lazy depraved weak tried get expelled from commune
careful sowing reaping peasants hay corn own few landowners their crops sown harvested early well got good return did nicholas
disliked having anything domestic serfs drones called everyone said spoiled laxity
when decision taken regarding domestic serf especially one punished always felt undecided consulted everybody house when possible domestic serf conscripted instead land worker did without least hesitation
never felt hesitation dealing peasants
knew every decision would approved all very few exceptions
did allow himself either hard punish man make things easy reward anyone merely felt inclined 
could said standard judged should should standard quite firm definite own mind
often speaking vexation failure irregularity would say can one our russian peasants imagined could bear 
yet loved our russian peasants their way life whole soul very reason understood assimilated one way manner farming produced good results
countess mary jealous passion husband regretted could share could understand joys vexations derived from world remote alien
could understand why particularly animated happy when after getting daybreak spending whole morning fields threshing floor returned from sowing mowing reaping tea 
did understand why spoke such admiration delight farming thrifty well peasant matthew erm shin family carted corn all night fact nicholas sheaves already stacked before anyone else harvest 
did understand why stepped out from window veranda smiled under mustache winked joyfully when warm steady rain began fall dry thirsty shoots young oats why when wind carried away threatening cloud during hay harvest would return from barn flushed sunburned perspiring smell wormwood gentian hair gleefully rubbing hands would say well one more day grain peasants will all under cover
still less did understand why kindhearted always ready anticipate wishes should become almost desperate when brought petition from peasant men women appealed excused work why kind nicholas should obstinately refuse angrily asking interfere business
felt world apart loved passionately laws fathomed
sometimes when trying understand spoke good work doing serfs would vexed reply least never entered head wouldn their good all poetry old wives talk all doing good one neighbor want our children should begging
must put our affairs order alive all
order strictness are essential
all about said clenching vigorous fist
fairness course added peasant naked hungry only one miserable horse can good either himself 
all nicholas did fruitful probably just refused allow himself think doing good others virtue sake
means increased rapidly serfsfrom neighboring estates came beg buy long after death memory administration devoutly preserved among serfs
peasants affairs first own
course trifled either word real master one matter connected management sometimes worried nicholas quick temper together old hussar habit making free use fists
first saw nothing reprehensible second year marriage view form punishment suddenly changed
once summer sent village elder from boguch rovo man succeeded post when dron died accused dishonesty various irregularities
nicholas went out into porch question immediately after elder given few replies sound cries blows heard
returning lunch nicholas went wife sat head bent low over embroidery frame usual began tell been doing morning
among other things spoke boguch rovo elder
countess mary turned red pale continued sit head bowed lips compressed gave husband reply
such insolent scoundrel cried growing hot again mere recollection 
told drunk did see
matter mary suddenly asked
countess mary raised head tried speak hastily looked down again lips puckered
why whatever matter dearest looks plain countess mary always improved when tears
never cried from pain vexation always from sorrow pity when wept radiant eyes acquired irresistible charm
moment nicholas took hand could longer restrain herself began cry
nicholas saw 
nicholas covered face hands
nicholas said nothing
flushed crimson left side paced down room
understood weeping about could heart once agree regarded from childhood quite everyday event wrong
just sentimentality old wives tales right asked himself
before solved point glanced again face filled love pain suddenly realized right long been sinning against himself
mary said softly going will never happen again give word
never repeated trembling voice like boy asking forgiveness
tears flowed faster still from countess eyes
took hand kissed 
nicholas when did break your cameo asked change subject looking finger wore ring cameo laoco head
today same affair
mary don remind again flushed
give word honor shan occur again let always reminder pointed broken ring
after when discussions village elders stewards blood rushed face fists began clench nicholas would turn broken ring finger would drop eyes before man making angry
did forget himself once twice within twelvemonth would confess wife would again promise should really very last time
mary must despise would say
should away once don feel strong enough control yourself would reply sadly trying comfort husband
among gentry province nicholas respected liked
did concern himself interests own class consequently thought proud others thought stupid
whole summer from spring sowing harvest busy work farm
autumn gave himself hunting same business like seriousness leaving home month even two hunt
winter visited other villages spent time reading
books read chiefly historical spent certain sum every year
collecting said serious library made rule read through all books bought
would sit study grave air reading task first imposed upon himself duty afterwards became habit affording special kind pleasure consciousness being occupied serious matters
winter except business excursions spent most time home making himself one family entering into all details children relations their mother
harmony between wife grew closer closer daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures 
from time marriage nya lived house
before nicholas told wife all passed between himself nya blaming himself commending 
asked princess mary gentle kind cousin
thoroughly realized wrong done nya felt herself blame toward imagined wealth influenced nicholas choice
could find fault nya way tried fond often felt ill will toward could overcome
once talk friend nat sha about nya about own injustice toward 
know said nat sha read gospels great deal there passage just fits nya
asked countess mary surprised
shall given from shall taken away
remember one why don know
perhaps lacks egotism don know from taken awayeverything been taken away
formerly very much wanted nicholas marry always sort presentiment would come off
sterile flower know like strawberry blossoms
sometimes sorry sometimes think doesn feel would
though countess mary told nat sha those words gospel must understood differently yet looking nya agreed nat sha explanation
really seemed nya did feel position trying grown quite reconciled lot sterile flower

nat sha married early spring 1813 1820 already three daughters besides son whom longed whom now nursing
grown stouter broader difficult recognize robust motherly woman slim lively nat sha former days
features more defined calm soft serene expression
face there none ever glowing animation formerly burned there constituted charm
now face body often allone saw soul visible all
all struck eye strong handsome fertile woman
old fire very rarely kindled face now
happened only when case day husband returned home sick child convalescent when countess mary spoke prince andrew never mentioned husband imagined jealous prince andrew memory rare occasions when something happened induce sing practice quite abandoned since marriage
rare moments when old fire did kindle handsome fully developed body even more attractive than former days
since their marriage nat sha husband lived moscow petersburg their estate near moscow mother say nicholas house
young countess bez khova often seen society those met there pleased found neither attractive nor amiable
nat sha liked solitude did know whether liked even thought did pregnancies confinements nursing children sharing every moment husband life demands time could satisfied only renouncing society
all known nat sha before marriage wondered change something extraordinary
only old countess maternal instinct realized all nat sha outbursts been due need children husband herself once exclaimed otr dnoe much fun earnest mothernow surprised surprise expressed those never understood nat sha kept saying always known nat sha would make exemplary wife mother
only lets love husband children overflow all bounds said countess even becomes absurd
nat sha did follow golden rule advocated clever folk especially french says girl should let herself when marries should neglect accomplishments should even more careful appearance than when unmarried should fascinate husbandmuch did before became husband
nat sha contrary once abandoned all witchery singing been unusually powerful part
gave just powerfully seductive
took pains manners delicacy speech toilet show herself husband most becoming attitudes avoid inconveniencing being exacting
felt allurements instinct formerly taught use would now merely ridiculous eyes husband whom from first moment given herself entirely whole soul leaving corner hidden from 
felt unity husband maintained poetic feelings attracted something else indefinite firm bond between own body soul
fluff out curls put fashionable dresses sing romantic songs fascinate husband would seemed strange adorn herselfattract herself
adorn herself others might perhaps been agreeable did know time all 
chief reason devoting time either singing dress choosing words really time spare things
know man faculty becoming completely absorbed subject however trivial may there subject trivial will grow infinite proportions one entire attention devoted 
subject wholly engrossed nat sha attention family husband whom keep should belong entirely home children whom bear bring into world nurse bring 
deeper penetrated mind only whole soul whole being into subject absorbed larger did subject grow weaker more inadequate did powers appear concentrated wholly one thing yet unable accomplish all considered necessary
there now conversations discussions about women rights relations husband wife their freedom rights though themes yet termed questions are now topics merely uninteresting nat sha positively did understand 
questions now existed only those see nothing marriage pleasure married people get from one another only beginnings marriage whole significance lies family
discussions questions kind are like question get greatest gratification from one dinner did now exist those whom purpose dinner nourishment affords purpose marriage family
purpose dinner nourish body man eats two dinnersonce may perhaps get more enjoyment will attain purpose stomach will digest two dinners
purpose marriage familyperson wishes many wives husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure case will family
purpose food nourishment purpose marriage family whole question resolves itself into eating more than one can digest having more wives husbands than are needed family one wife one husband
husband given gave family
only saw need other better husband all powers soul intent serving husband family could imagine saw interest imagining would things different
nat sha did care society general prized more society relatives countess mary brother mother nya
valued company those whom could come striding disheveled from nursery dressing gown joyful face show yellow instead green stain baby napkin from whom could hear reassuring words effect baby much better
such extent nat sha let herself way dressed did hair ill chosen words jealousy jealous nya governess every woman pretty plain habitual subjects jest those about 
general opinion pierre under wife thumb really true
from very first days their married life nat sha announced demands
pierre greatly surprised wife view perfectly novel one every moment life belonged family
wife demands astonished also flattered submitted 
pierre subjection consisted fact only dared flirt dared even speak smilingly other woman did dare dine club pastime did dare spend money whim did dare absent himself length time except business wife included intellectual pursuits did least understand attributed great importance
make home pierre right regulate life whole family exactly chose
home nat sha placed herself position slave husband whole household went tiptoe when occupied reading writing study
pierre show partiality anything get just liked done always
only express wish nat sha would jump run fulfill 
entire household governed according pierre supposed orders wishes nat sha tried guess
their way life place residence their acquaintances ties nat sha occupations children upbringing all selected merely regard pierre expressed wishes nat sha from thoughts expressed conversation supposed wishes 
deduced essentials wishes quite correctly having once arrived clung tenaciously
when pierre himself wanted change mind would fight own weapons
thus time trouble ever memorable after birth their first child delicate when change wet nurse three times nat sha fell ill from despair pierre one day told rousseau view quite agreed wet nurse unnatural harmful
when next baby born despite opposition mother doctors even husband himself all vigorously opposed nursing baby herselfthing unheard considered injurious insisted having own way after nursed all babies herself
very often happened moment irritation husband wife would dispute long afterwards pierre surprise delight would find wife ideas actions very thought against argued divested everything superfluous excitement dispute added when expressing opinion
after seven years marriage pierre joyous firm consciousness bad man felt saw himself reflected wife
felt good bad within himself inextricably mingled overlapping
only really good reflected wife all quite good rejected
result logical reasoning direct mysterious reflection
two months previously when pierre already staying rost received letter from prince theodore asking come petersburg confer important questions being discussed there society pierre one principal founders
reading letter always read husband letters nat sha herself suggested should petersburg though would feel absence very acutely
attributed immense importance all husband intellectual abstract interests though did understand always dreaded being hindrance such matters
pierre timid look inquiry after reading letter replied asking fix definite date return
given four weeks leave absence
ever since leave absence expired more than fortnight before nat sha been constant state alarm depression irritability
den sov now general retired list much dissatisfied present state affairs arrived during fortnight
looked nat sha sorrow surprise bad likeness person once dear
dull dejected look random replies talk about nursery all saw heard from former enchantress
nat sha sad irritable all time especially when mother brother nya countess mary their efforts console tried excuse pierre suggested reasons delay returning
all nonsense all rubbish those discussions lead nothing all those idiotic societies nat sha declared very affairs immense importance firmly believed
would nursery nurse tya only boy
one else could tell anything comforting reasonable little three month old creature when lay breast conscious movement lips snuffling little nose
creature said are angry are jealous would like pay out are afraid 
unanswerable
during fortnight anxiety nat sha resorted baby comfort often fussed over much overfed fell ill
terrified illness yet just needed
attending bore anxiety about husband more easily
nursing boy when sound pierre sleigh heard front door old nurse knowing please mistress entered room inaudibly hurriedly beaming face
come nat sha asked quickly whisper afraid move lest should rouse dozing baby

baby again opened eyes looked

cautiously withdrawing breast nat sha rocked little handed nurse went rapid steps toward door
door stopped conscience reproached having joy left child soon glanced round
nurse raised elbows lifting infant over rail cot
don worry whispered smiling kind familiarity grows between nurse mistress
nat sha ran light footsteps anteroom

moment nicholas countess mary came 
pierre baby hand stooped kissed replied their inquiries
spite much interesting discussed baby little cap unsteady head evidently absorbed all attention

pierre suddenly exclaimed laugh shifting baby gave nurse
every large household there bald hills several perfectly distinct worlds merged into one harmonious whole though each retained own peculiarities made concessions others
every event joyful sad took place house important all worlds each own special reasons rejoice grieve over occurrence independently others

pierre however adored
did want hussar knight 
george like uncle nicholas wanted learned wise kind like pierre
pierre presence face always shone pleasure flushed breathless when pierre spoke 
did miss single word uttered would afterwards dessalles himself recall reconsider meaning everything pierre said
pierre past life unhappiness prior 1812 young nicholas formed vague poetic picture from words overheard adventures moscow captivity plat karat whom heard from pierre love nat sha whom lad also particularly fond especially pierre friendship father whom nicholas could remember all made pierre eyes hero saint
from broken remarks about nat sha father from emotion pierre spoke dead father from careful reverent tenderness nat sha spoke boy only just beginning guess love derived notion father loved nat sha when dying left friend
father whom boy did remember appeared divinity could pictured whom never thought without swelling heart tears sadness rapture
boy also happy pierre arrived
guests welcomed pierre always helped enliven unite company 
grown members family mention wife pleased back friend whose presence made life run more smoothly peacefully
old ladies pleased presents brought especially nat sha would now herself again
pierre felt different outlooks various worlds made haste satisfy all their expectations
though most absent minded forgetful men pierre aid list wife drew now bought everything forgetting mother brother law commissions nor dress material present bel nor toys wife nephews
early days marriage seemed strange wife should expect forget procure all things undertook buy been taken aback serious annoyance when first trip forgot everything
knowing nat sha asked nothing herself gave commissions others only when himself offered undertake now found unexpected childlike pleasure purchase presents everyone house never forgot anything
now incurred nat sha censure only buying many expensive things
other defects most people thought pierre qualities untidiness neglect herself now added stinginess
from time pierre began life family man footing entailing heavy expenditure noticed surprise spent only half much before affairs been disorder late chiefly first wife debts begun improve
life cheaper circumscribed most expensive luxury kind life can changed moment longer nor did wish 
felt way life now been settled once all till death change power way life proved economical
merry smiling face pierre sorting purchases
think said unrolling piece stuff like shopman
nat sha sitting opposite eldest daughter lap turned sparkling eyes swiftly from husband things showed 
bel excellent felt quality material

when wear nat sha stuck coil hair
when take little sha into society perhaps will fashionable again 
collecting presents went first nursery old countess rooms
countess sitting companion bel playing grand patience usual when pierre nat sha came into drawing room parcels under their arms
countess now over sixty quite gray wore cap frill surrounded face
face shriveled upper lip sunk eyes dim
after deaths son husband such rapid succession felt herself being accidentally forgotten world left without aim object existence
ate drank slept kept awake did live
wanted nothing from life tranquillity tranquillity only death could give 
until death came living use vital forces
peculiarity one sees very young children very old people particularly evident 
life external aims only need exercise various functions inclinations apparent
eat sleep think speak weep work give vent anger merely stomach brain muscles nerves liver
did things under external impulse people full vigor life when behind purpose strive exercising their functions remains unnoticed
talked only physically needed exercise tongue lungs
cried child does nose cleared 
people their full vigor aim evidently merely pretext
thus morning especially eaten anything rich day before felt need being angry would choose handiest pretext bel deafness
would begin say something low tone from other end room
seems little warmer today dear would murmur
when bel replied yes come would mutter angrily lord stupid deaf another pretext would snuff would seem dry damp rubbed fine enough
after fits irritability face would grow yellowmaids knew infallible symptoms when bel would again deaf snuff damp countess face yellow
just needed work off spleen sometimes exercise still existing faculty thinking pretext game patience
when needed cry deceased count would pretext
when wanted agitated nicholas health would pretext when felt need speak spitefully pretext would countess mary
when vocal organs needed exercise usually toward seven clock when after dinner rest darkened room pretext would retelling same stories over over again same audience
old lady condition understood whole household though one ever spoke all made every possible effort satisfy needs
only rare glance exchanged sad smile between nicholas pierre nat sha countess mary common understanding condition expressed
those glances expressed something more said played part life now saw whole self must all become like glad yield restrain themselves once precious being formerly full life themselves now much pitied
memento mori said glances
only really heartless stupid ones household little children failed understand avoided 
when pierre wife entered drawing room countess one customary states needed mental exertion playing patience though force habit greeted words always used when pierre son returned after absence high time dear high time all weary waiting 
well thank god received presents another customary remark gift precious dear give old woman

nat sha pierre left alone also began talk only husband wife can talk extraordinary clearness rapidity understanding expressing each other thoughts ways contrary all rules logic without premises deductions conclusions quite peculiar way
nat sha used kind talk husband surest sign something being wrong between pierre followed line logical reasoning
when began proving anything talking argumentatively calmly led example began same knew verge quarrel
from moment alone nat sha came wide open happy eyes quickly seizing head pressed bosom saying now are all mine mine won escape from moment conversation began contrary all laws logic contrary quite different subjects talked about one same time
simultaneous discussion many topics did prevent clear understanding contrary surest sign fully understood one another
just dream when all uncertain unreasoning contradictory except feeling guides dream intercourse contrary all laws reason words themselves consecutive clear only feeling prompted 
nat sha spoke pierre about brother life doings suffered lacked life during own absence fonder than ever mary mary every way better than herself

understand value opens fresh line said repeating words pierre once uttered
chief point nicholas ideas discussions are amusement almost pastime said pierre
instance collecting library made rule buy new book till read already bought sismondi rousseau montesquieu added smile
began soften down said nat sha interrupted show unnecessary
say ideas are amusement 
yes nothing else serious
all time petersburg saw everyone dream
when taken thought all else mere amusement
sorry wasn there when met children said nat sha
most delighted lisa sure
yes pierre replied went mind
nicholas says ought think
besides when petersburg felt can say whole affair would pieces without everyone pulling own way
succeeded uniting all idea clear simple
see don say ought oppose 
may mistaken
say join hands love right let there one banner active virtue
prince serg fine fellow clever
nat sha would doubt greatness pierre idea one thing disconcerted 
can man important necessary society also husband did happen wished express doubt 
now could decide whether really cleverer than all others asked herself passed review all those whom pierre most respected
judging said there one respected highly plat karat 
know thinking about asked
would approved now think pierre all surprised question
understood wife line thought
plat karat repeated pondered evidently sincerely trying imagine karat opinion subject
would understood
love awfully nat sha suddenly said
awfully awfully would approved said pierre after reflection
would approved our family life
always anxious find seemliness happiness peace everything should been proud let see 
there now talk absence wouldn believe special feeling after separation
yes should think

one couldn love more something special
yes course did finish their eyes meeting said rest
nonsense nat sha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons greatest happiness first contrary now best all
only did away remember quarreled always fault
quarreled about don even remember always about same thing said pierre smile
don say can bear nat sha cried eyes glittered coldly vindictively
did see added after pause
shouldn recognized 
silent 
know talking study looking nat sha began evidently anxious disperse cloud come over 
are like two peas like boy
meant little son
time 
sorry leave 
silent few seconds
suddenly turning one another same time both began speak
pierre began self satisfaction enthusiasm nat sha quiet happy smile
having interrupted one another both stopped let other continue

did say 
talking nonsense said nat sha
pierre finished begun
sequel complacent reflections success petersburg
moment seemed chosen give new direction whole russian society whole world
only wished say ideas great results are always simple ones
whole idea vicious people are united constitute power honest folk must same
yes
going say only nonsense
all same nothing only trifle said nat sha smiling still more brightly
only wanted tell about tya today nurse coming take from laughed shut eyes clung 
sure thought hiding
well good left room
meanwhile downstairs young nicholas bolk nski bedroom little lamp burning usual
boy afraid dark could cure 
dessalles slept propped four pillows roman nose emitted sounds rhythmic snoring
little nicholas just waked cold perspiration sat bed gazed before wide open eyes
dreamed uncle pierre wearing helmets such depicted plutarch leading huge army
army made white slanting lines filled air like cobwebs float about autumn dessalles called les fils rge
front glory similar those threads rather thicker
pierre borne along lightly joyously nearer nearer their goal
suddenly threads moved began slacken become entangled grew difficult move
uncle nicholas stood before stern threatening attitude
done said pointing broken sealing wax pens
loved orders from arakch will kill first moves forward
little nicholas turned look pierre pierre longer there
place father prince andrew father neither shape nor form existed when little nicholas perceived grew faint love felt himself powerless limp formless
uncle nicholas came nearer nearer 
terror seized young nicholas awoke
father thought
though there two good portraits prince andrew house nicholas never imagined human form
father been caressed 
approved uncle pierre
whatever may tell will 
mucius scaevola burned hand
why should same sort thing happen know want learn
someday shall finished learning will something
only pray god something may happen such happened plutarch men will act did
will better
everyone shall know love delighted suddenly bosom heaved sobs began cry
are ill heard dessalles voice asking
answered nicholas lay back pillow
good kind fond thought dessalles
uncle pierre wonderful man father father father yes will something even would satisfied
history life nations humanity
seize put into words describe directly life humanity even single nation appears impossible
ancient historians all employed one same method describe seize apparently elusive life people
described activity individuals ruled people regarded activity those men representing activity whole nation
question did individuals make nations act wished will individuals themselves guided ancients met recognizing divinity subjected nations will chosen man guided will chosen man accomplish ends predestined
ancients questions solved belief direct participation deity human affairs
modern history theory rejects both principles
would seem having rejected belief ancients man subjection deity predetermined aim toward nations are led modern history should study manifestations power causes produce 
having theory rejected view held ancients still follows practice
instead men endowed divine authority directly guided will god modern history given either heroes endowed extraordinary superhuman capacities simply men very various kinds from monarchs journalists lead masses
instead former divinely appointed aims jewish greek roman nations ancient historians regarded representing progress humanity modern history postulated own aims welfare french german english people highest abstraction welfare civilization humanity general usually meant peoples occupying small northwesterly portion large continent
modern history rejected beliefs ancients without replacing new conception logic situation obliged historians after apparently rejected divine authority kings fate ancients reach same conclusion another road recognize nations guided individual men existence known aim nations humanity large are tending
basis works all modern historians from gibbon buckle despite their seeming disagreements apparent novelty their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions
first place historian describes activity individuals opinion directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals ministers being such men another includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers poets 
secondly assumed goal toward humanity being led known historians one goal greatness roman spanish french realm another liberty equality certain kind civilization small corner world called europe
1789 ferment arises paris grows spreads expressed movement peoples from west east
several times moves eastward collides countermovement from east westward
1812 reaches extreme limit moscow remarkable symmetry countermovement occurs from east west attracting first movement done nations middle europe
counter movement reaches starting point first movement west paris subsides
during twenty year period immense number fields left untilled houses burned trade changed direction millions men migrated impoverished enriched millions christian men professing law love their fellows slew one another
does all mean why did happen made those people burn houses slay their fellow men causes events force made men act are instinctive plain most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when encounters monuments tradition period
reply questions common sense mankind turns science history whose aim enable nations humanity know themselves
history retained conception ancients would said god reward punish people gave napoleon power directed will fulfillment divine ends reply would been clear complete
one might believe disbelieve divine significance napoleon anyone believing there would been nothing unintelligible history period nor would there been contradictions
modern history cannot give reply
science does admit conception ancients direct participation deity human affairs therefore history ought give other answers
modern history replying questions says want know movement means caused force produced events listen louis xiv very proud self confident man such such mistresses such such ministers ruled france badly
descendants weak men ruled france badly
such such favorites such such mistresses
moreover certain men wrote books time
end eighteenth century there couple dozen men paris began talk about all men being free equal
caused people all over france begin slash drown one another
time there france man genius napoleon
conquered everybody everywhere killed many people great genius
reason went kill africans killed well cunning wise when returned france ordered everybody obey all obeyed 
having become emperor again went out kill people italy austria prussia
russia there emperor alexander decided restore order europe therefore fought against napoleon
1807 suddenly made friends 1811 again quarreled again began killing many people
napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia captured moscow suddenly ran away from moscow emperor alexander helped advice stein others united europe arm against disturber peace
all napoleon allies suddenly became enemies their forces advanced against fresh forces raised
allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon abdicate sent island elba depriving title emperor showing every respect though five years before one year later all regarded outlaw brigand
louis xviii till been laughingstock both french allies began reign
napoleon shedding tears before old guards renounced throne went into exile
skillful statesmen diplomatists especially talleyrand managed sit down particular chair before anyone else thereby extended frontiers france talked vienna conversations made nations happy unhappy
suddenly diplomatists monarchs nearly quarreled point again ordering their armies kill one another just napoleon arrived france battalion french been hating immediately all submitted 
allied monarchs angry went fight french once more
defeated genius napoleon suddenly recognizing brigand sent island 
exile separated from beloved france dear heart died lingering death rock bequeathed great deeds posterity
europe reaction occurred sovereigns once again all began oppress their subjects
would mistake think ironic caricature historical accounts
contrary very mild expression contradictory replies meeting questions all historians give from compilers memoirs histories separate states writers general histories new histories culture period
strangeness absurdity replies arise from fact modern history like deaf man answers questions one asked
purpose history give description movement humanity peoples first question absence reply all rest will incomprehensible power moves peoples modern history laboriously replies either napoleon great genius louis xiv very proud certain writers wrote certain books
all may mankind ready agree asked
all would interesting recognized divine power based itself always consistently directing nationsthrough napoleons louis writers acknowledge such power therefore before speaking about napoleons louis authors ought shown connection existing between men movement nations
instead divine power other forceappeared should explained new forceconsists whole interest history lies precisely force
history seems assume force self evident known everyone
spite every desire regard known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether new force variously understood historians themselves really quite well known everybody
force moves nations biographical historians historians separate nations understand force power inherent heroes rulers
their narration events occur solely will napoleon alexander general persons describe
answers given kind historian question force causes events happen are satisfactory only long there one historian each event
soon historians different nationalities tendencies begin describe same event replies give immediately lose all meaning force understood all only differently often quite contradictory ways
one historian says event produced napoleon power another produced alexander third due power other person
besides historians kind contradict each other even their statement force authority particular person based
thiers bonapartist says napoleon power based virtue genius
lanfrey republican says based trickery deception people
historians class mutually destroying one another positions destroy understanding force produces events furnish reply history essential question
writers universal history deal all nations seem recognize erroneous specialist historians view force produces events
recognize power inherent heroes rulers resultant multiplicity variously directed forces
describing war subjugation people general historian looks cause eventpower one man interaction many persons connected event
according view power historical personages represented product many forces can longer would seem regarded force itself produces events
yet most cases universal historians still employ conception power force itself produces events treat their cause
their exposition historic character first product time power only resultant various forces power itself force producing events
gervinus schlosser others instance one time prove napoleon product revolution ideas 1789 forth another plainly say campaign 1812 other things like simply product napoleon misdirected will very ideas 1789 arrested their development napoleon caprice
ideas revolution general temper age produced napoleon power
napoleon power suppressed ideas revolution general temper age
curious contradiction accidental
only does occur every step universal historians accounts are all made chain such contradictions
contradiction occurs after entering field analysis universal historians stop halfway
find component forces equal composite resultantforce sum components must equal resultant
condition never observed universal historians explain resultant forces are obliged admit addition insufficient components another unexplained force affecting resultant action
specialist historians describing campaign 1813 restoration bourbons plainly assert events produced will alexander
universal historian gervinus refuting opinion specialist historian tries prove campaign 1813 restoration bourbons due other things beside alexander will such activity stein metternich madame sta talleyrand fichte chateaubriand others
historian evidently decomposes alexander power into components talleyrand chateaubriand rest sum components interactions chateaubriand talleyrand madame sta others evidently does equal resultant namely phenomenon millions frenchmen submitting bourbons
chateaubriand madame sta others spoke certain words one another only affected their mutual relations does account submission millions
therefore explain from relations theirs submission millions people resulted component forces equal one gave resultantequal thousand times historian again obliged fall back power force denied recognize resultantforces admit unexplained force acting resultant
just universal historians consequently only contradict specialist historians contradict themselves
peasants having clear idea cause rain say according whether want rain fine weather wind blown cloudsaway wind brought clouds
same way universal historians sometimes when pleases fits their theory say power result eventssometimes when want prove something else say power produces events
third class historians called historians culture following path laid down universal historians sometimes accept writers ladies forces producing events again take force something quite different
see called culture mental activity
historians culture are quite consistent regard their progenitors writers universal histories historical events may explained fact certain persons treated one another such such ways why explain fact such such people wrote such such books immense number indications accompanying every vital phenomenon historians select indication intellectual activity say indication cause
despite their endeavors prove cause events lies intellectual activity only great stretch can one admit there connection between intellectual activity movement peoples case can one admit intellectual activity controls people actions view confirmed such facts very cruel murders french revolution resulting from doctrine equality man very cruel wars executions resulting from preaching love
even admitting correct all cunningly devised arguments histories are filled admitting nations are governed undefined force called idea history essential question still remains unanswered former power monarchs influence advisers other people introduced universal historians another newer force idea added connection masses needs explanation
possible understand napoleon power events occurred effort one may even conceive napoleon together other influences cause eventbook contrat social effect making frenchmen begin drown one another cannot understood without explanation causal nexus new force event
undoubtedly relation exists between all live contemporaneously possible find connection between intellectual activity men their historical movements just such connection may found between movements humanity commerce handicraft gardening anything else please
why intellectual activity considered historians culture cause expression whole historical movement hard understand
only following considerations can led historians such conclusion history written learned men natural agreeable think activity their class supplies basis movement all humanity just similar belief natural agreeable traders agriculturists soldiers express merely traders soldiers write history spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner very easy use words having still less definite meaning can therefore readily introduced into theory
speak intrinsic quality histories kind may possibly even use someone something histories culture all general histories tend more more approximate are significant from fact after seriously minutely examining various religious philosophic political doctrines causes events soon describe actual historic event such campaign 1812 instance involuntarily describe resulting from exercise power say plainly result napoleon will
speaking historians culture involuntarily contradict themselves show new force devised does account happens history history can only explained introducing power apparently recognize
locomotive moving
someone asks moves peasant says devil moves 
another man says locomotive moves wheels round
third asserts cause movement lies smoke wind carries away
peasant irrefutable
refute someone would prove there devil another peasant would explain devil german moves locomotive
only result contradiction will see are both wrong
man says movement wheels causerefutes himself having once begun analyze ought explain further why wheels round till reached ultimate causemovement locomotive pressure steam boiler right stop search cause
man explains movement locomotive smoke carried back noticed wheels supply explanationtaken first sign occurs turn offered explanation
only conception can explain movement locomotive force commensurate movement observed
only conception can explain movement peoplesforce commensurate whole movement peoples
yet supply conception various historians take forces different kinds all are incommensurate movement observed
see force directly inherent heroes peasant sees devil locomotive others force resulting from several other forces like movement wheels others again intellectual influence like smoke blown away
long histories are written separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers voltaires histories all absolutely all those take part event quite impossible describe movement humanity without conception force compelling men direct their activity toward certain end
only such conception known historians power
conception one handle means material history present expounded can dealt anyone breaks handle off buckle did without finding other method treating historical material merely deprives himself one possible way dealing 
necessity conception power explanation historical events best demonstrated universal historians historians culture themselves professedly reject conception inevitably recourse every step
dealing humanity inquiry science history now like money circulation paper money coin
biographies special national histories are like paper money
can used can circulate fulfill their purpose without harm anyone even advantageously long one asks security behind 
need only forget ask will heroes produces events such histories thiers will interesting instructive may perhaps even possess tinge poetry
just doubts real value paper money arise either being easy make much gets made people try exchange gold also doubts concerning real value such histories arise either many are written simplicity heart someone inquires force did napoleon wants exchange current paper money real gold actual comprehension
writers universal histories history culture are like people recognizing defects paper money decide substitute money made metal specific gravity gold
may indeed make jingling coin will more than 
paper money may deceive ignorant nobody deceived tokens base metal value merely jingle
gold gold only serviceable merely exchange also use universal historians will valuable only when can reply history essential question power universal historians give contradictory replies question historians culture evade answer something quite different
counters imitation gold can used only among group people agree accept gold among those know nature gold universal historians historians culture answering humanity essential question serve currency purposes their own only universities among mass readers taste call serious reading
having abandoned conception ancients divine subjection will nation chosen man subjection man will deity history cannot without contradictions take single step till chosen one two things either return former belief direct intervention deity human affairs definite explanation meaning force producing historical events termed power
return first impossible belief been destroyed essential explain meant power
napoleon ordered army raised war
are accustomed idea become used question why did six hundred thousand men fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems senseless
power ordered done
reply quite satisfactory believe power given god
soon admit becomes essential determine power one man over others
cannot direct physical power strong man over weak one domination based application threat physical force like power hercules nor can based effect moral force their simplicity historians think say leading figures history are heroes men gifted special strength soul mind called genius
power cannot based predominance moral strength mention heroes such napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows neither louis nor metternich ruled overmillions people particular moral qualities contrary generally morally weaker than millions ruled over
source powerlies neither physical nor moral qualities possesses must evidently looked elsewhere relation people man wields power
power understood science jurisprudence exchange bank history offers exchange history understanding power true gold
power collective will people transferred expressed tacit consent their chosen rulers
domain jurisprudence consists discussions state power might arranged possible all arranged all very clear when applied history definition power needs explanation
science jurisprudence regards state power ancients regarded fire namely something existing absolutely
history state power are merely phenomena just modern physics fire element phenomenon
from fundamental difference between view held history held jurisprudence follows jurisprudence can tell minutely opinion power should constituted power existing immutably outside time history questions about meaning mutations power time can answer nothing
power collective will people transferred their ruler pugach representative will people why napoleon why napoleon iii criminal when taken prisoner boulogne why later those criminals whom arrested palace revolutions sometimes only two three people take part transfer will people new ruler international relations will people also transferred their conqueror will confederation rhine transferred napoleon 1806 will russian people transferred napoleon 1809 when our army alliance french went fight austrians questions three answers are possible either assume will people always unconditionally transferred ruler rulers chosen therefore every emergence new power every struggle against power once appointed should absolutely regarded infringement real power will people transferred rulers conditionally under definite known conditions show all limitations conflicts even destructions power result from nonobservance rulers conditions under their power entrusted will people delegated rulers conditionally conditions are unknown indefinite appearance several authorities their struggles their falls result solely from greater lesser fulfillment rulers unknown conditions will people transferred from people others
are three ways historians explain relation people their rulers
historians those biographical specialist historians already referred their simplicity failing understand question meaning power seem consider collective will people unconditionally transferred historical persons therefore when describing single state assume particular power one absolute real power other force opposing power violation power mere violence
their theory suitable primitive peaceful periods history inconvenience application complex stormy periods life nations during various powers arise simultaneously struggle one another legitimist historian will prove national convention directory bonaparte mere infringers true powerrepublican bonapartist will prove one convention other empire real powerall others violations power
evidently explanations furnished historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children
recognizing falsity view history another set historians say power rests conditional delegation will people their rulers historical leaders power only conditionally carrying out program will people tacit agreement prescribed 
program consists historians say continually contradict one another
each historian according view constitutes nation progress looks conditions greatness wealth freedom enlightenment citizens france other country
mention historians contradictions nature program even admitting one general program conditions exists facts history almost always contradict theory
conditions under power entrusted consist wealth freedom enlightenment people louis xiv terrible end their reigns tranquilly louis xvicharles are executed their people question historians reply louis xiv activity contrary program reacted louis xvi
why did react louis xiv louis why should react just louis xvi time limit such reactions questions there are can answers
equally little does view explain why several centuries collective will withdrawn from certain rulers their heirs suddenly during period fifty years transferred convention directory napoleon alexander louis xviii napoleon again charles louis philippe republican government napoleon iii
when explaining rapid transfers people will from one individual another especially view international relations conquests alliances historians are obliged admit transfers are normal delegations people will are accidents dependent cunning mistakes craft weakness diplomatist ruler party leader
greater part events history civil wars revolutions conquests are presented historians results free transferences people will results ill directed will one more individuals once again usurpations power
historians also see admit historical events are exceptions theory
historians resemble botanist having noticed plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist all grows does sprouting into two leaves palm mushroom even oak blossom into full growth longer resemble two leaves are deviations from theory
historians third class assume will people transferred historic personages conditionally conditions are unknown 
say historical personages power only fulfill will people been delegated 
case force moves nations lies historic leaders nations themselves significance those leaders leaders historians tell express will peopleactivity leaders represents activity people
case question arises whether all activity leaders serves expression people will only part 
whole activity leaders serves expression people will historians suppose all details court scandals contained biographies napoleon catherine serve express life nation evident nonsense only particular side activity historical leader serves express people life other called philosophical historians believe determine side activity leader expresses nation life first all know nation life consists
met difficulty historians class devise most obscure impalpable general abstraction can cover all conceivable occurrences declare abstraction aim humanity movement
most usual generalizations adopted almost all historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization culture
postulating generalization goal movement humanity historians study men whom greatest number monuments remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes journalists extent their opinion persons promoted hindered abstraction
way proved aim humanity does consist freedom equality enlightenment civilization connection people rulers enlighteners humanity only based arbitrary assumption collective will people always transferred men whom noticed happens activity millions migrate burn houses abandon agriculture destroy one another never expressed account activity dozen people did burn houses practice agriculture slay their fellow creatures
history proves every turn
ferment peoples west end eighteenth century their drive eastward explained activity louis xiv xvi their mistresses ministers lives napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais others movement russian people eastward kaz siberia expressed details morbid character terrible correspondence rbski movement peoples time crusades explained life activity godfreys louis their ladies movement peoples from west east without leaders crowd vagrants peter hermit remains incomprehensible
yet more incomprehensible cessation movement when rational sacred aim crusade deliverance jerusalem been clearly defined historic leaders
popes kings knights incited peoples free holy land people did unknown cause previously impelled longer existed
history godfreys minnesingers can evidently cover life peoples
history godfreys minnesingers remained history godfreys minnesingers history life peoples their impulses remained unknown
still less does history authors reformers explain life peoples
history culture explains impulses conditions life thought writer reformer
learn luther hot temper said such such things learn rousseau suspicious wrote such such books learn why after reformation peoples massacred one anothernor why during french revolution guillotined one another
unite both kinds history done newest historians shall history monarchs writers history life peoples
life nations contained lives few men connection between those men nations been found
theory connection based transference collective will people certain historical personages hypothesis unconfirmed experience history
theory transference collective will people historic persons may perhaps explain much domain jurisprudence essential purposes application history soon revolutions conquests civil wars occur soon history begins theory explains nothing
theory seems irrefutable just act transference people will cannot verified never occurred
whatever happens whoever may stand head affairs theory can always say such such person took lead collective will transferred 
replies theory gives historical questions are like replies man watching movements herd cattle paying attention varying quality pasturage different parts field driving herdsman should attribute direction herd takes animal happens head
herd goes direction animal front leads collective will all other animals vested leader
historians first class say those assume unconditional transference people will
animals leading herdchange happens collective will all animals transferred from one leader another according whether animal leading direction selected whole herd
such reply historians assume collective will people delegated rulers under conditions regard known
method observation often happens observer influenced direction himself prefers regards those leaders owing people change direction are longer front one side even rear
animals front are continually changing direction whole herdconstantly altered order follow given direction animals transfer their will animals attracted our attention study movements herdmust watch movements all prominent animals moving all sides herd
say third class historians regard all historical persons from monarchs journalists expression their age
theory transference will people historic persons merely paraphrase restatement question other words
causes historical events power
power power collective will people transferred one person
under condition will peopledelegated one person condition person expresses will whole people
power power other words power word meaning understand
realm human knowledge confined abstract reasoning having subjected criticism explanation power juridical science gives humanity would conclude power merely word real existence
understand phenomena man besides abstract reasoning experience verifies reflections
experience tells power merely word actually existing phenomenon
speak fact description collective activity men can without conception power existence power proved both history observing contemporary events
whenever event occurs man appears men appear whose will event seems taken place
napoleon iii issues decree french mexico
king prussia bismarck issue decrees army enters bohemia
napoleon issues decree army enters russia
alexander gives command french submit bourbons
experience shows whatever event occurs always related will one several men decreed 
historians accord old habit acknowledging divine intervention human affairs want see cause events expression will someone endowed power supposition confirmed either reason experience
one side reflection shows expression man will words are only part general activity expressed event instance war revolution without assuming incomprehensible supernatural force miracle one cannot admit words can immediate cause movements millions men
other hand even admitted words could cause events history shows expression will historical personages does most cases produce effect say their commands are often executed sometimes very opposite order occurs
without admitting divine intervention affairs humanity cannot regard power cause events
power from standpoint experience merely relation exists between expression someone will execution will others
explain conditions relationship must first establish conception expression will referring man deity
deity issues command expresses will ancient history tells expression will independent time caused anything divinity controlled event
speaking commands are expression will men acting time relation one another explain connection commands events must restore condition all takes place continuity movement time both events person commands inevitability connection between person commanding those execute command
only expression will deity dependent time can relate whole series events occurring over period years centuries only deity independent everything can sole will determine direction humanity movement man acts time himself takes part occurs
reinstating first condition omitted time see command can executed without preceding order having been given rendering execution last command possible
command ever appears spontaneously itself covers whole series occurrences each command follows from another never refers whole series events always one moment only event
when instance say napoleon ordered armies war combine one simultaneous expression whole series consecutive commands dependent one another
napoleon could commanded invasion russia never did 
today ordered such such papers written vienna berlin petersburg tomorrow such such decrees orders army fleet commissariat millions commands formed whole series corresponding series events brought french armies into russia
throughout reign napoleon gave commands concerning invasion england expended other undertaking much time effort yet during whole reign never once attempted execute design undertook expedition into russia country considered desirable alliance conviction repeatedly expressed came about commands did correspond course events first case did correspond latter
order certainly executednecessary man should order can executed
know can cannot executed impossible only case napoleon invasion russia millions participated even simplest event either case millions obstacles may arise prevent execution
every order executed always one immense number unexecuted
all impossible orders inconsistent course events remain unexecuted
only possible ones get linked consecutive series commands corresponding series events are executed
our false conception event caused command precedes due fact when event taken place out thousands others those few commands consistent event been executed forget about others executed could 
apart from chief source our error matter due fact historical accounts whole series innumerable diverse petty events such instance all those led french armies russia generalized into one event accord result produced series events corresponding generalization whole series commands also generalized into single expression will
say napoleon wished invade russia invaded 
reality all napoleon activity never find anything resembling expression wish find series orders expressions will very variously indefinitely directed
amid long series unexecuted orders napoleon one series campaign 1812 carried out those orders differed way from other unexecuted orders coincided course events led french army into russia just stencilwork figure comes out color laid from side way laid from all sides over figure cut stencil
examining relation time commands events find command can never cause event certain definite dependence exists between two
understand dependence consists necessary reinstate another omitted condition every command proceeding from deity from man man gives command himself takes part event
relation commander those commands just called power
relation consists following common action people always unite certain combinations regardless difference aims set common action relation between those taking part always same
men uniting combinations always assume such relations toward one another larger number take more direct share smaller number less direct share collective action combined
all combinations men unite collective action one most striking definite examples army
every army composed lower grades service rank file whom there are always greatest number next higher military rank corporals noncommissioned officers whom there are fewer still higher officers whom there are still fewer highest military command concentrated one person
military organization may quite correctly compared cone base largest diameter consists rank file next higher smaller section cone consists next higher grades army apex point will represent commander chief
soldiers whom there are most form lower section cone base
soldier himself does stabbing hacking burning pillaging always receives orders actions from men above himself never gives order
noncommissioned officers whom there are fewer perform action itself less frequently than soldiers already give commands
officer still less often acts directly himself commands still more frequently
general does nothing command troops indicates objective hardly ever uses weapon himself
commander chief never takes direct part action itself only gives general orders concerning movement mass troops
similar relation people one another seen every combination men common activity agriculture trade every administration
without particularly analyzing all contiguous sections cone ranks army ranks positions administrative public business whatever from lowest highest see law men take associated action combine such relations more directly participate performing action less can command more numerous are less their direct participation action itself more command fewer there are rising way from lowest ranks man top takes least direct share action directs activity chiefly commanding
relation men command those command constitutes essence conception called power
having restored condition time under all eventsoccur find command executed only when related corresponding series events
restoring essential condition relation between those command those execute find very nature case those command take smallest part action itself their activity exclusively directed commanding
when event taking place people express their opinions wishes about event results from collective activity many people one opinions wishes expressed sure fulfilled approximately
when one opinions expressed fulfilled opinion gets connected event command preceding 
men are hauling log
each expresses opinion where haul 
haul log away happens done one said
there command power their primary form
man worked most hands could think much about doing reflect command would result from common activityman commanded more would evidently work less hands account greater verbal activity
when larger concourse men direct their activity common aim there yet sharper division those their activity given directing commanding take less part direct work
when man works alone always certain set reflections seems directed past activity justify present activity guide planning future actions
just same done concourse people allowing those take direct part activitydevise considerations justifications surmises concerning their collective activity
reasons known unknown french began drown kill one another
corresponding event justification appears people belief necessary welfare france liberty equality
people ceased kill one another event accompanied justification necessity centralization power resistance europe 
men went from west east killing their fellow men event accompanied phrases about glory france baseness england 
history shows justifications events common sense are all contradictory case killing man result recognizing rights killing millions russia humiliation england
justifications very necessary significance their own day
justifications release those produce events from moral responsibility
temporary aims are like broom fixed front locomotive clear snow from rails front clear men moral responsibilities from their path
without such justification there would reply simplest question presents itself when examining each historical event
millions mencommit collective crimes make war commit murder present complex forms political social life europe can event prescribed decreed ordered monarchs ministers parliaments newspapers imagined there collective action cannot find justification political unity patriotism balance power civilization every event occurs inevitably coincides expressed wish receiving justification presents itself result will one man several men
whatever direction ship moves flow waves cuts will always noticeable ahead 
those board ship movement those waves will only perceptible motion
only watching closely moment moment movement flow comparing movement ship convince ourselves every bit occasioned forward movement ship led into error fact ourselves imperceptibly moving
see same watch moment moment movement historical characters establish inevitable condition all occurs continuity movement time lose sight essential connection historical persons masses
when ship moves one direction there one same wave ahead when turns frequentlywave ahead also turns frequently
wherever may turn there always will wave anticipating movement
whatever happens always appears just event foreseen decreed
wherever ship may rush water neither directs nor increases movement foams ahead distance seems merely move itself govern ship movement also
examining only those expressions will historical persons commandsrelated events historians assumed events depended those commands
examining eventsthemselves connection historical persons stood people found their orders dependent events
incontestable proof deduction however many commands issued event does take place unless there are other causes soon event occurs may out all continually expressed wishes different people will always found their meaning their time utterance are related commands events
arriving conclusion can reply directly positively two essential questions history power force produces movement nations power relation given person other individuals more person expresses opinions predictions justifications collective actionperformed less participation action
movement nations caused power nor intellectual activity nor even combination two historians supposed activity all people participate events always combine such way those taking largest direct share event take themselves least responsibility vice versa
morally wielder powerappears cause event physically those submit power
moral activity inconceivable without physical cause event neither one nor other union two
other words conception cause inapplicable phenomena are examining
last analysis reach circle infinity final limit every domain thought man reason arrives playing subject
electricityproduces heat heat produces electricity
speaking interaction heat electricity atoms cannot say why occurs say inconceivable otherwise must law
same applies historical events
why war revolution occur know
only know produce one other action people combine certain formation all take part say unthinkable otherwise other words law
history dealt only external phenomena establishment simple obvious law would suffice should finished our argument
particle matter cannot tell does feel lawattraction repulsion lawuntrue man subject history says plainly free therefore subject law
presence problem man free will though unexpressed felt every step history
all seriously thinking historians involuntarily encountered question
all contradictions obscurities history false path historical science followed are due solely lack solution question
will every man free each man could act pleased all history would series disconnected incidents
thousand years even one man million could act freely chose evident one single free act man violation laws governing human action would destroy possibility existence laws whole humanity
there single lawgoverning actions men free will cannot exist man will subject law
contradiction lies problem free will from most ancient times occupied best human minds from most ancient times been presented whole tremendous significance

observing himself man sees will always directed one same law whether observes necessity taking food using brain anything else cannot recognize never varying direction will otherwise than limitation 
free could limited
man will seems limited just conscious except free
say free
lifted hand let fall
everyone understands illogical reply irrefutable demonstration freedom
reply expression consciousness subject reason
consciousness freedom separate independent source self consciousness would subject reasoning experience fact such subjection does exist inconceivable
series experiments arguments proves every man object observation subject certain laws man submits never resists laws gravity impermeability once become acquainted 
same series experiments argumentsproves complete freedom conscious himself impossible every action depends organization character motives acting upon yet man never submits deductions experiments arguments
having learned from experiment argument stone falls downwards man indubitably believes always expects law learned fulfilled
learning just certainly will subject laws does cannot believe 
however often experiment reasoning may show man under same conditions same character will same thing before yet when under same conditions same character approaches thousandth time action always ends same way feels certainly convinced before experiment can act pleases
every man savage sage however incontestably reason experiment may prove impossible imagine two different courses action precisely same conditions feels without irrational conception constitutes essence freedom cannot imagine life
feels however impossible may without conception freedom only would unable understand life would unable live single moment
could live all man efforts all impulses life are only efforts increase freedom
wealth poverty fame obscurity power subordination strength weakness health disease culture ignorance work leisure repletion hunger virtue vice are only greater lesser degrees freedom
man having freedom cannot conceived except deprived life
conception freedom appears reasonsenseless contradiction like possibility performing two actions one same instant time effect without cause only proves consciousness subject reason
unshakable irrefutable consciousness freedom uncontrolled experiment argument recognized all thinkers felt everyone without exception consciousness without conception man possible constitutes other side question
man creation all powerful all good all seeing god
sin conception arises from consciousness man freedom question theology
actions men are subject general immutable laws expressed statistics
man responsibility society conception results from conception freedom question jurisprudence
man actions proceed from innate character motives acting upon 
conscience perception right wrong actions follows from consciousness freedom question ethics
man connection general lifehumanity appears subject laws determine life
same man apart from connection appears free
should past life nations humanity regarded result free result constrained activity man question history
only our self confident day popularization knowledge thanks most powerful engine ignorance diffusion printed matter question freedom will been put level question itself cannot exist
our time majority called advanced people crowd ignoramuses taken work naturalists deal one side question solution whole problem
say write print soul freedom exist life man expressed muscular movements muscular movements are conditioned activity nerves soul free will exist unknown period time sprang from apes
say all suspecting thousands years ago same law necessity such ardor are now trying prove physiology comparative zoology merely acknowledged all religions all thinkers never been denied
see role natural sciences matter merely serve instrument illumination one side 
fact from point view observation reason will are merely secretions brain man following general law may developed from lower animals unknown period time only explains from fresh side truth admitted thousands years ago all religious philosophic theories from point view reason man subject law necessity does advance hair breadth solution question another opposite side based consciousness freedom
men descended from apes unknown period time comprehensible made from handful earth certain period time first case unknown quantity time second case origin question man consciousness freedom reconciled law necessity subject cannot solved comparative physiology zoology frog rabbit ape can observe only muscular nervous activityman observe consciousness well muscular nervous activity
naturalists their followers thinking can solve question are like plasterers set plaster one side walls church availing themselves absence chief superintendent work should access zeal plaster over windows icons woodwork still unbuttressed walls should delighted from their point view plasterers everything now smooth regular
solution question free will inevitability history advantage over other branches knowledge question dealt history question does refer essence man free will manifestation past under certain conditions
regard question history stands other sciences experimental sciencestands abstract science
subject history man will itself our presentation 
history insoluble mystery presented incompatibility free will inevitability does exist does theology ethics philosophy
history surveys presentation man life union two contradictions already taken place
actual life each historic event each human action very clearly definitely understood without sense contradiction although each event presents itself partly free partly compulsory
solve question freedom necessity are combined constitutes essence two conceptions philosophy history can should follow path contrary taken other sciences
instead first defining conceptions freedom inevitability themselves ranging phenomena life under those definitions history should deduce definition conception freedom inevitability themselves from immense quantity phenomena cognizant always appear dependent two elements
whatever presentation activity many men individual may consider always regard result partly man free will partly law inevitability
whether speak migration peoples incursions barbarians decrees napoleon iii someone action hour ago choosing one direction out several walk are unconscious contradiction
degree freedom inevitability governing actions people clearly defined 
our conception degree freedom often varies according differences point view from regard event every human action appears certain combination freedom inevitability
every action examine see certain measure freedom certain measure inevitability
always more freedomsee action less inevitability perceive more inevitability less freedom
proportionfreedom inevitability decreases increases according point view from action regarded their relation always one inverse proportion
sinking man clutches another drowns hungry mother exhausted feeding baby steals food man trained discipline duty word command kills defenseless man seem less guilty less free more subject law necessity one knows circumstances people placed more free one does know man himself drowning mother hungry soldier ranks 
similarly man committedmurder twenty years ago since lived peaceably harmlessly society seems less guilty action more due law inevitability someone considers action after twenty years elapsed than one examined day after committed
same way every action insane intoxicated highly excited man appears less free more inevitable one knows mental condition committed action seems more free less inevitable one does know 
all cases conception freedom increased diminished conception compulsion correspondingly decreased increased according point view from action regarded
greater conception necessity smaller conception freedom vice versa
religion common sense mankind science jurisprudence history itself understand alike relation between necessity freedom
all cases without exception our conception freedom necessity increased diminished depend three considerations relation external world man commits deeds
relation time
relation causes leading action
first consideration clearness our perception man relation external world greater lesser clearness our understanding definite position occupied man relation everything coexisting 
makes evident drowning man less free more subject necessity than one standing dry ground makes actions man closely connected others thickly populated district one bound family official business duties seem certainly less free more subject necessity than those man living solitude seclusion
consider man alone apart from relation everything around each action seems free
see relation anything around see connection anything whatever man speaks book reads work engaged even air breathes light falls things about see each circumstances influence controls least side activity
more perceive influences more our conception freedom diminishes more our conception necessity weighs increases
second consideration more less evident timerelation man world clearness our perception place man action occupies time
ground makes fall first man resulting production human race appear evidently less free than man entry into marriage today
reason why life activity people lived centuries ago are connected time cannot seem free life contemporary consequences are still unknown 
degree our conception freedom inevitability depends respect greater lesser lapse time between performance action our judgment 
examine act performed moment ago approximately same circumstances those now action appears undoubtedly free
examine act performed month ago being different circumstances cannot help recognizing act been committed much resulted from good agreeable even essential would taken place
reflect action still more remote ten years ago more consequences action are still plainer find hard imagine would happened action been performed
farther back memory same thing farther forward judgment more doubtful becomes belief freedom action
history find very similar progress conviction concerning part played free will general affairs humanity
contemporary event seems indubitably doing all known participants more remote event already see inevitable results prevent our considering anything else possible
farther back examining events less arbitrary appear
austro prussian war appears undoubtedly result crafty conduct bismarck 
napoleonic wars still seem though already questionably outcome their heroes will
crusades already see event occupying definite place history without cannot imagine modern history europe though chroniclers crusades event appeared merely due will certain people
regard migration peoples does enter anyone head today suppose renovation european world depended attila caprice
farther back history object our observation lies more doubtful does free will those concerned event become more manifest law inevitability
third consideration degree apprehend endless chain causation inevitably demanded reason each phenomenon comprehended therefore man every action must definite place result gone before cause will follow
better are acquainted physiological psychological historical laws deduced observation man controlled more correctly perceive physiological psychological historical causes action simpler action are observing less complex character mind man question more subject inevitability less free our actions those others appear
when all understand cause action whether crime good action even one simply nonmoral ascribe greater amount freedom 
case crime most urgently demand punishment such act case virtuous act rate merit most highly
indifferent case recognize more individuality originality independence
even one innumerable causes act known recognize certain element necessity are less insistent punishment crime acknowledgment merit virtuous act freedom apparently original action
criminal reared among malefactors mitigates fault our eyes
self sacrifice father mother self sacrifice possibility reward more comprehensible than gratuitous self sacrifice therefore seems less deserving sympathy less result free will
founder sect party inventor impresses less when know way prepared activity
large range examples our observation constantly directed seeking correlation cause effect people actions their actions appear more under compulsion less free more correctly connect effects causes
examined simple actions vast number such actions under observation our conception their inevitability would still greater
dishonest conduct son dishonest father misconduct woman fallen into bad company drunkard relapse into drunkenness are actions seem less free better understand their cause
man whose actions are considering very low stage mental development like child madman simpleton knowing causes act simplicity character intelligence question see large element necessity little free will soon know cause prompting action can foretell result
three considerations alone based conception irresponsibility crimes extenuating circumstances admitted all legislative codes
responsibility appears greater less according our greater lesser knowledge circumstances man placed whose actionbeing judged according greater lesser interval time between commission actioninvestigation according greater lesser understanding causes led action
thus our conception free will inevitability gradually diminishes increases according greater lesser connection external world greater lesser remoteness time greater lesser dependence causes relation contemplate man life
examine case man whose connection external world well known where time between action examination great where causes action are most accessible get conception maximum inevitability minimum free will
examine man little dependent external conditions whose action performed very recently causes whose action are beyond our ken get conception minimum inevitability maximum freedom
neither case however may change our point view however plain may make ourselves connection between man external world however inaccessible may however long short period time however intelligible incomprehensible causes action may can ever conceive either complete freedom complete necessity
whatever degree may imagine man exempt from influence external world never get conception freedom space
every human action inevitably conditioned surrounds own body
action seems free asking myself whether could raise arm every direction see raised direction there least obstruction action either from things around from construction own body
chose one out all possible directions there fewest obstacles
action free necessary should encounter obstacles
conceive man being free must imagine outside space evidently impossible
however much approximate timejudgment timedeed never get conception freedom time
examine action committedsecond ago must still recognize being free irrevocably linked moment committed
can lift arm lift ask myself could abstained from lifting arm momentalready passed convince myself lift next moment
now abstaining from doing first moment when asked question
time gone could detain arm lifted longer same arm now refrain from lifting nor air lifted same now surrounds 
moment first movement made irrevocable moment could make only onemovement whatever movement made would only one
did lift arm moment later does prove could abstained from lifting 
since could make only one movement single moment time could been other
imagine free necessary imagine present boundary between past future outside time impossible
however much difficulty understanding causes may increased never reach conception complete freedom absence cause
however inaccessible may cause expression will action our own another first demand reason assumption search cause without cause phenomenon conceivable
raise arm perform actionindependently cause wish perform actionwithout cause cause action
even imagining manquite exempt from all influences examining only momentary action present unevoked cause admit infinitely small remainder inevitability equaled zero should even arrived conception complete freedom manbeing uninfluenced external world standing outside time independent cause longer man
same way can never imagine action man quite devoid freedom entirely subject law inevitability
however may increase our knowledge conditions spaceman situated knowledge can never complete number those conditions infinite infinity space
therefore long all conditions influencing men are defined there complete inevitability certain measure freedom remains
however may prolong period time between action are examining judgment upon period will finite time infinite respect there can never absolute inevitability
however accessible may chain causation action shall never know whole chain since endless again never reach absolute inevitability
besides even admitting remaining minimum freedom equal zero assumed given case instance dying manunborn babe idiot complete absence freedom doing should destroy very conception mancase are examining soon there freedom there also man
conception actionman subject solely law inevitability without element freedom just impossible conception man completely free action
imagine action man entirely subject law inevitability without freedom must assume knowledge infinite number space relations infinitely long period time infinite series causes
imagine man perfectly free subject law inevitability must imagine all alone beyond space beyond time free from dependence cause
first case inevitability possible without freedom should reached definition inevitability laws inevitability itself mere form without content
second case freedom possible without inevitability should arrived unconditioned freedom beyond space time cause fact being unconditioned unlimited would nothing mere content without form
should fact reached those two fundamentals man whole outlook universe constructed incomprehensible essencelife laws defining essence
reason says space all forms matter give visibility infinite cannot imagined otherwise
time infinite motion without moment rest unthinkable otherwise
connection between cause effect beginning can end
consciousness says alone all exists consequently include space
measure flowing timefixed moment present alone conscious myself living consequently outside time
beyond cause feel myself cause every manifestation life
reason gives expression laws inevitability
consciousness gives expression essence freedom
freedom limited anything essence life man consciousness
inevitability without content man reason three forms
freedom thing examined
freedom content
only separating two sources cognition related one another form content get mutually exclusive separately incomprehensible conceptions freedom inevitability
only uniting get clear conception man life
apart from two concepts their union mutually define one another form content conception life possible
all know life man merely certain relation free will inevitability consciousness laws reason
all know external world nature only certain relation forces nature inevitability essence life laws reason
great natural forces lie outside are conscious call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force are conscious force life man call freedom
just force gravitation incomprehensible itself felt every man understood only extent know laws inevitability subject from first knowledge all bodies weight newton law force free will incomprehensible itself everyone conscious intelligible only far know laws inevitability subject from fact every man dies knowledge most complex economic historic laws 
all knowledge merely bringing essence life under laws reason
man free will differs from every other forceman directly conscious eyes reason way differs from other force
forces gravitation electricity chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another are differently defined reason
just force man free will distinguished reason from other forces nature only definition reason gives 
freedom apart from necessity apart from laws reason define differs way from gravitation heat force makes things grow reason only momentary undefinable sensation life
undefinable essence force moving heavenly bodies undefinable essence forces heat electricity chemical affinity vital force forms content astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology just same way does force free will form content history
just subject every science manifestation unknown essence life essence itself can only subject metaphysicseven manifestation force free will human beings space time dependence cause forms subject history free will itself subject metaphysics
experimental sciences know call laws inevitability unknown call vital force
vital force only expression unknown remainder over above know essence life
also history known call laws inevitability unknown call free will
free will history only expression unknown remainder know about laws human life
history examines manifestations man free will connection external world time dependence cause defines freedom lawsreason history science only far free will defined those laws
recognition man free will something capable influencing historical events subject laws same history recognition free force moving heavenly bodies would astronomy
assumption would destroy possibility existence laws science whatever
there even single body moving freely laws kepler newton are negatived conception movement heavenly bodies longer exists
single action due free will single historical law can exist nor conception historical events
history lines exist movement human wills one end hidden unknown other end consciousness man will present moves space time dependence cause
more field motion spreads out before our eyes more evident are laws movement
discover define those laws problem history
from standpoint from science history now regards subject path now follows seeking causes events man free will scientific enunciation those laws impossiblehowever man free will may restricted soon recognize force subject law existence law becomes impossible
only reducing element free will infinitesimal regarding infinitely small quantity can convince ourselves absolute inaccessibility causes instead seeking causes history will take discovery laws problem
search laws long been begun new methods thought history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously self destruction toward ever dissecting dissecting causes phenomena old method history moving
all human sciences traveled along path
arriving infinitesimals mathematics most exact sciences abandons process analysis enters new process integration unknown infinitely small quantities
abandoning conception cause mathematics seeks law property common all unknown infinitely small elements
another form along same path reflection other sciences proceeded
when newton enunciated law gravity did say sun earth property attraction said all bodies from largest smallest property attracting one another leaving aside question cause movement bodies expressed property common all bodies from infinitely large infinitely small
same done natural sciences leaving aside question cause seek laws
history stands same path
history object study movement nations humanity narration episodes lives individuals setting aside conception cause should seek laws common all inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements free will
from time law copernicus discovered proved mere recognition fact sun earth moves sufficed destroy whole cosmography ancients
disproving law might been possible retain old conception movements bodies without disproving would seem impossible continue studying ptolemaic worlds
even after discovery law copernicus ptolemaic worlds still studied long time
from time first person said proved number births crimes subject mathematical laws mode government determined certain geographical economic conditions certain relations population soil produce migrations peoples foundations history been built destroyed their essence
refuting new laws former view history might been retained without refuting would seem impossible continue studying historic events results man free will
certain mode government established certain migrations peoples took place consequence such such geographic ethnographic economic conditions free will those individuals appear established mode government occasioned migrations can longer regarded cause
yet former history continues studied side side laws statistics geography political economy comparative philology geology directly contradict assumptions
struggle between old views new long stubbornly fought out physical philosophy
theology stood guard old views accused new violating revelation
when truth conquered theology established itself just firmly new foundation
just prolonged stubborn struggle now proceeding between old new conception history theology same way stands guard old view accuses new view subverting revelation
one case other both sides struggle provokes passion stifles truth
one hand there fear regret loss whole edifice constructed through ages other passion destruction
men fought against rising truths physical philosophy seemed admitted truth would destroy faith god creation firmament miracle joshua son nun
defenders laws copernicus newton voltaire example seemed laws astronomy destroyed religionutilized law gravitation weapon against religion
just now seems only admit law inevitability destroy conception soul good evil all institutions state church been built those conceptions
like voltaire time uninvited defenders law inevitability today use law weapon against religion though law inevitability history like law copernicus astronomy far from destroying even strengthens foundation institutions state church are erected
question astronomy question history now whole difference opinion based recognition nonrecognition something absolute serving measure visible phenomena
astronomy immovability earth history independence personality free will
astronomy difficulty recognizing motion earth lay abandoning immediate sensation earth fixity motion planets history difficulty recognizing subjection personalitylaws space time cause lies renouncing direct feeling independence one own personality
astronomy new view said true feel movement earth admitting immobility arrive absurdity admitting motion feel arrive lawsalso history new view says true are conscious our dependence admitting our free will arrive absurdity admitting our dependence external world time cause arrive laws
first case necessary renounce consciousness unreal immobility space recognize motion did feel present case similarly necessary renounce freedom does exist recognize dependence are conscious
